2.0
★★★★★
Former Employee ",full-time, more than 5 years,12,"- Well known organization in Hong Kong (when you say that you work for HKJC people will tend to associate it positively: large organization, race courses, major events)

- Some recent executives hires (smart / competent guys) are starting to voice what should be done. The problem is that some other people, above them, are not letting them executing in this direction.","- Lack of company culture.
The tagline ""One Club, One team, One Vision"" couldn't be more off the reality. Teams are siloed and tend to not want to work with each others. Basically some teams have developed fortress around them to protect their work, knowledge and ultinatelly their job. As a result, it's a pain to get people from different teams to work together. It's even sometimes impossible.
Vision. Top managers do not articulate clearly and communicate HKJC's vision (if not that it is a world leader in horse racing). Basically, one could feel like if the whole strategy was top secret and should only be known by the board of Stuart, BoM and executives. In this context, how do you want teams to be motivated and work together in the right direction?
Also, few to no offsite. Basically, you spend all your time at the office which is a toxic situation. HKJC also celebrates individual performance (naming people during townhall), not teams.

- Company organization.
The Board of Stuart is all powerful. Surely these people are experienced and smart but i believe they are outdated and not in phase with the reality of things. They are also risk averse. Most execs know this but noone dare to say it. In a context of command and control you will be singled out and noone will support what you say. I believe the CEO is very capable but not empowed to do his job properly. In this context, the company cannot work well, you need to fix the foundation first before spending a massive amount of cash on other matters.

- Failure is not allowed. KPIs are aligned with technical performance in a context where most systems are aging. As a result people are afraid of change (it could cause incidents) and protect their silo (my silo did its job, look, here is the signature, that's must be someone else). How do you want improvement in such context? Failure is part of the learning process.

- People are not valued.
Dozens of very competent people are hired (in a way lured by what they sell you which is often different from the reality) and then leave within a year because they do not feel valued or find the working style too messy (""messy"" is a word used by hundred of people to define HKJC's working environment). 
The building at Sha Tin racecource (SCTC) is big, recent and modern however it quickly become a boring place. The rooftop area is massive but poorly utilized. There is no gym facility quicly accessible (you need at least 15 minutes to get to an old style gym room) and restaurant options are poor (the food in the building is not good / healthy).

- People are not empowered.
They treat people like dumb. A developer will spend a significant amount of her/his time in meetings and writing documentation instead of writing code.
Staff are mostly scared to voice their opinion or suggest improvements. The reason being the command and control culture in place.
HKJC also use a lot of vendors instead of relying on its internal staff to do the job. My take on this is that only vendor will stand HKJC's culture and thus do the job till the end (because they are paid to do it).
They do not invest in their own people. Training are also poor.

- Architectural decisions are poor.
This is IT specific but given that their whole business is IT based any wrong decision made here will slow you down.

- Products are too complex.
Operations are too complex, made of too many approval process (normal in a command and control culture). They should simplify operations and services / products. This is also the problem of monopolies who want every single feature instead of making economic choices. As a result, your IT and whole company is in a pain to support so many services / products.

- Creativity is absent.
I haven't seen any creative solution while working there. It goes in pair with not empowring people, fear of voicing opinion and command and control culture. As a example, they are still developig solution like QR code. The mobile apps are also extremely poor.

- Executives are too proud to listen.
Smart internal staffs and consultants have advised HKJC on what they should be doing to improve but suggestions were constantly rejected. The ""open door policy"" is not representative of a behavior of listening to people. There are cases were the staff is threatened or being talked aggressively too because they voice their opinion.

- Retaining people not competent enough. Many people have been working there for decades and life employment at HKJC is a concept that is still there. So HKJC keeps its people even if they are aggressive towards other people, low performers, putting hurdles into other people's way or else. If you are working there, you will have to deal with these people and thus waste time.

- Long working hours because of presenteeism, quantity of meetings, people not competent enough who need to be repeated multiple times what should be done. Working hours are defined such as 8:43 to 6:37 (where on earth do you see this anymore?).

At this point in time (2020) i would not suggest to work for their IT and Sustainability, HR, Marketing or other departments heavily administered. Wait at least a few years to see if their culture gets better.
Risk department may be a better working environment.
Regarding the Charities department, i don't know.

Time is your most important asset, always make best use of it.","Read the above cons.
Implement solutions asap starting with quick wins.
Stop hiding the truth and denying facts but acknowledge problems and start working on them as well as show results.
Have a talk with the Board of Stuart about this culture issue and get them to understand that in normal companies the CEO is empowered to make decisions. The BoS could be an advisory board, that's it.",2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

Former Employee ",full-time,,3,never get fired and you can stay in same grade/position forever if you are a perm staff. good for stable,"1. poor culture - no training no support no team building, they expect you to do a lot of tasks and know everything from first day so you have to spend a lot of time to figure out by yourself and there are many manual works

2. long work hour - official hour is 0900-1848 for back office plus OT without pay/meal/transports

3. less AL - starting from 7 days for contract and 12 days for perm

4. poor medical - only can choose panel doctors, you cannot claim if your doctor is not on panel list

5. poor systems - my computer is local (can't access the files from other computers) with 500GB hard disk and MS Office 2007. the systems are not used friendly

6. low salary - heavy workload and if you stay longer, your salary will be far lower than new hire who has same grade as internal increment is far lower than the market",be open minded,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,
