Actually listen to your ERG groups, they are the best part and the backbone of your company. Listen to your good managers and stop keeping the rotten ones.","I was at Github a while back, several months ago. I wanted to give it a minute so I could write a level-headed review. Now I'm at a another company and chilled out and reflective about my experience. 

I'm going to start with my criticism of the ERG groups (Octogatos, Blacktocats, and Octoqeers) because I think it's both Github's biggest strength and downfall. They have great people there that they completely underutilize and continue to lose.

While I did see a lot of growth and opportunity during my years at the company, as well as women in positions of leadership -- overall Github's efforts for diversity and inclusion are largely lip service and anecdotal - as some of those same women in leadership unfortunately contribute to the problem all the same as the men. A layoff last year included mostly women (and more specifically BIPOC women) which was whispered through the company and handled TERRIBLY. I also saw several woman (incl women of color, as well as lgbt women incl myself) leave my own team within my short time there. As a matter of fact, my sr manager only hired former employees from the same regional company s/he had previously worked for. For this position, they had the opportunity to interview (frankly over)qualified men and women color for a sr engineering position which took quite literally over a dozen hours to interview for, only to have an engineer GIVEN to us from sr leadership...because somebody knew him from our Parent company -- I never even interviewed him for the position. What the hell was the point of 12 hours of interviews and lengthy greenhouse submissions, then?

Overall turnover and burnout rate continues to be an issue as people were hired and left shortly thereater, from what I could see, an average of a year. Nepotism in management runs very deep. Escalations to leadership are unheard and empty, as on more than one occasion Ive heard of employees (incl myself) being written up for speaking out for feeling uncomfortable. If you want to know about the company's history of performative bullcrap, look no further than when they signed a contract with ICE only to have a wave of internal employee complaints including a TOWN HALL where the head of legal spoke out against our CEO. This also spread on twitter, news media outlets, and the internal employee petition that was signed by many people (myself included) which you can still find as a pull request if you're working there. Services like the Octogatos and Blacktocats are great and a wonderful start to reel people in but ultimately the buck stops at senior leadership who seem to believe in employee empowerment & open door policies at a surface level only. This does not diminish the work of the wonderful people overseeing and contributing to these employee initiatives and is indicative only of the program management that stifles their efforts. This goes from individual team leadership all the way up to HR and the executive board. 

This is all contrary to the supposed work-life balance and unlimited PTO the remote infrastructure would indicate. Much like other elite tech companies, Github suffers the Silicon Valley-esque allure wherein they'll convince you that you're a chosen Golden Child for being blessed for the opportunity to be working for them. Imposter Syndrome is talked about often, even for new hires, but then when you actually do your 1:1s or skip level and want to give open door policy feedback about/to your manager - you can quite literally retaliated against. That isn't to say that Github doesn't have wonderful managers among the lot, just that they are trapped in an unfortunately nepotistic system that is def present from the top, down. After spending a few years there I'm actually more convinced that these lectures about Imposter Syndrome during new hire orientation were actually meant to beat you down/convince you that you shouldn't work there, so that you feel bad for speaking up. ""We all feel it! Don't worry! Just talk to your manager if you're having problems with xyz because we'll be here for you."" It's baloney. In my own direct experience (as well as others, the network of people who have left the company is large and we do talk), that...is definitely the case. 

The benefits package is nice but leaves a lot to be desired when work hours aren't respected. Maternity leave for mothers is great until mothers are still pressured or feel bothered by upper management to do daily check ins. ""COVID flex time"" as I'll call it based on the company memo that was sent out, is given as lip service but when someone in your family is effected by the pandemic - suicide, healthcare workers, general anhedonia and new severe depression diagnosis are a few I heard -- there is virtually no sympathy given and project deadlines are all that matter. The best parts all come when you onboard, which is nice. The telecommunications stipend, home office setup, and offer to buy back the laptop were all nice. 

Lack of clarity and constant restructuring of departments are par the course and expected. If you're a new hire now, I would quite literally expect that you have a new manager and quite possibly new team by the end of the year due to high turnover. This is every team, though I saw it especially often on cloud services, security, and legal. 

Overall it seems like my experience at Github is pretty typical. You'll find some really awesome peers, coworkers, and management really trying to do the right thing. But overall everyone gets fed up with the entrenched nepotism and lack of oversight (as well as frequent unheard employee complaints) eventually. *shrugs*",2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

In spite of those things, which I consider a few bumps in the road, I find that the company has an amazing culture and that they spend a lot of effort in trying to keep the culture open, friendly, respectful and inclusive. Sure, things have changed, and maybe 2 years ago, the culture was better than now, but even so, this is much better than so many other companies that have strict hierarchies, bully and toxic cutures, or that give you barely 10 days of time off. I feel happy and valued at GitHub and it has improved my quality of life ten-fold from my previous job. I feel that many people at GitHub do not realize how good it is at GitHub and they focus on the few negative areas that can be improved, and do not realize that other companies are so much worse. My personal experience has been great and all in all it's one of the best companies to work for, and I have already been lucky to work for 2 other amazing companies.","I am very concerned that this is too good to stay this way, and my biggest concern is about the GitHub acquisition. Other cons are that there is ambiguity and constant change. Also, lately we have more restrictions about much we can spend on the phones we use for work or laptops get now replaced less often. This makes me feel that will be even tighter once we are under Microsoft.","Improve communication. Sometimes, several months go by before we have a company all-hands meeting.

A very expensive SF office space to work in for those who work in SF.,"There is no leadership to speak of. From the Executives to middle management there is no experience and no direction. GitHub went from a ""no managers"" environment to promoting managers from within who lack management experience and training. This has led to a highly political, cliquey culture that favors ""friends"" and punishes those ""outside of the circle"".

Chris Wanstrath's commitment to ""Diversity & Exclusion"" has led to hiring practices where managers say, ""we're not hiring any more white males"" or ""we're not hiring that transgender person because they used to be a white male"" or yet, ""we're not interested in that black man. We really want to hire a woman for this role"". All true statements personally heard. It has gotten to the point of reviewing the candidates Linkedin profile photo to see if they are a ""good fit"" for an interview. Wrong race? Wrong gender? Cancel the interview.

There is no accountability and no ramifications to any of these actions. It's widely accepted and expected. This practice is so well known and runs so deep that very manager and director is complacent in this practice.

Interview feedback is routinely deleted if it's not favorable for a ""diversity hire"". Didn't pass the technical interview? We'll delete that and give you an easier one so that a sub-par engineer can be hired. This has lead to the rapid decline of the engineering talent.","Now that Microsoft has announced the deal to acquire GitHub they need to come in and clean house.

They work in an environment that is very remote-friendly as well as accommodating to SF-based employees, with a boatload of exceptional perks and thoughtfulness toward a solid work-life balance.

Plus, when you leave - either by your own decision or through their now well-known layoff cycles - you'll have a brand name worth its weight in gold on your resume.","No matter how good of an environment GitHub creates, nobody actually does their best work there. This is due to a culture that rewards politics and favoritism over merit and cultural contributions to the organization.

There's a reason why GitHub alumni do great things once they leave the company. GitHubbers are becoming CEOs, Heads of Product, and leaders at other successful companies - it's surprising that GitHub simply considered them expendable.

In addition, GitHub does not seem to understand how to reward and retain good employees, and it makes dubious decisions on staffing. You could be producing exceptional work one day but find yourself on a Performance Improvement Plan - or, even worse, shown the door and locked out of your accounts - the next. 

All of this boils down to an executive and management team that wildly varies in its ability to lead. Some have years of solid experience with just a few areas of growth needed; others are completely in over their heads and are given no true compass to follow, causing their departments to suffer.

The people are what make it. While I've been at GitHub, I've had incredible conversations about how to be a better person, how to encourage more women to enter tech, and how to make the open source community a better place. All of these conversations have so far been informal and outside of GitHub's larger strategies for social impact. I'm just happy to work among such thoughtful people. 

It's been great to get to know my coworkers even though I'm working remotely. It's hard sometimes, but I feel like GitHub gives remote employees many opportunities to meet each other and feel like they're still part of the team. If I start feeling weird or excluded, I can express that and something will change to make me feel more included. I also know I can take a trip to San Francisco and work with my team for a week or two. 

Finally, it doesn't hurt that the benefits are insane. There are a few I haven't even taken advantage of, yet, because they seem so extravagant. I feel taken care of to say the least.","There is some tension as the company grows and changes. People who've been working at GitHub for a while seem to sense that it is losing something—it's open culture, maybe. I think there are people who are actively fighting against this loss, and overall it is heading in the right direction. It does cause some awkwardness, though, and I do hope we can maintain what people feel was so special.

As I said, working remotely is tough. Sometimes I feel like I would be better at my job if I worked at HQ, just for the exposure to serendipitous interactions and the ability to yell across the room at my coworkers.","Encourage and maintain communication. In fact, over-communicate whenever possible. I think that would help the company feel more unified, and prevent the communication fails that happen now and then.",5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,,,,
0,0,0,8 June 2015,23:52:57,"Great company, great colleagues, great :heart:", Software Engineer,"Remote, OR",Current Employee ,full-time, more than a year,23,"The best part about working at GitHub is the great colleagues! They are uniformly friendly, super talented, and have a positive, supportive attitude. All the engineers I have worked with have been really motivated and produce high-quality work.

A majority of GitHub employees work remotely; some in small satellite offices but most at home/cafes/shared office space/whatever. Because of this, the company goes to a lot of effort to make remote work effective. Communications are largely asynchronous (e.g., via GitHub issues and pull requests), most meetings are streamed and recorded, and there are lots of chances to meet other GitHubbers when necessary: the annual company summit, mini-summits for departments or teams kicking off a project, plus we are welcome to travel to visit HQ or other GitHubbers when we feel the urge to connect. Most ""synchronous"" discussion takes place in online chat, though even here transcripts are kept for anybody to read. Time zones can be a real hassle but otherwise it all works quite well. It's so awesome being able to work for a San Francisco-based company while being able to live almost anywhere!

The company is very transparent. Many company-wide issues are discussed in the open, and anybody's input is welcome.

Until the beginning of 2014, GitHub didn't have any formal management structure to speak of. The result was predictable: people worked on what they found exciting, but it was hard to gather critical mass to implement large-scale projects. Since then people-managers have been introduced, which has improved the company focus. So far management has used a relatively light touch. In particular, work is still mostly organized by the engineers working on it rather than top-down by management. In my opinion the introduction of management has improved the company, though it has definitely caused a shift in the culture.

GitHub the company also seems to have a good heart. As far as I can tell, everybody at the company from top to bottom is really trying hard to do the right thing:

* There is a constant internal dialog about how to improve diversity, both within GitHub (e.g., by doing everything we can to eliminate bias in our recruiting processes) and also within the whole industry (for example by supporting organizations and events that are targeted at underrepresented groups). This isn't just an HR goal; we are all thinking about it.
* We do everything we can to support open-source software. Most obviously, we provide free Git hosting to open-source projects, and we give our free users every bit the same level of support as we give to our paying customers. We contribute internally-developed code to upstream open-source projects as much as possible. We have ""open-source Fridays"" twice a month when GitHubbers are encouraged to work on open source projects. We sponsor many open-source conferences and other events.
* GitHub promotes a healthy work-life balance. I guess (being alpha-geeks) a lot of us work too many hours. But that pressure doesn't come from the company. I've never seen anything but encouragement for people announcing vacation (which is unlimited) or taking parental leave (4 months PTO for new parents).

Finally, it's great to build a product that millions of people use and love. It's a pleasure to run into GitHub users in real life because they are so positive about the company. We're helping to propagate the open-source ethos:

* We provide a great place for open-source projects to host their code.
* Companies use GitHub to promote code-sharing and communal development internally, and often to open-source internal projects.
* There are even governments that put draft legislation in GitHub and allow citizens to propose pull requests to change it.

Reading back over what I've written, it sounds like I'm a marketing shill. But in fact I'm just a very happy software engineer. After nearly two years at the company I am still almost giddy that I get to work at GitHub.","Remote work impedes serendipitous communication. It's an effort to keep up with what is happening in the rest of the company when you don't bump into your colleagues in the kitchen or in the elevator.

As a hangover from the management-free days, it can sometimes still be hard to figure out who is in charge of what.","With employees the caliber of GitHub's, a little management goes a long way. Be careful not to allow management to grow into a separate caste. Especially, don't let it evolve into a dynamic where edicts flow down and no information/feedback flows up.

We don't have much of a presence outside of the walls we work in when it comes to Glassdoor, Linkedin and other sites that potential employees do the usual poking around in before they apply. I was cautious to throw my name into the hat for these very reasons. 

Each article I pulled up was outdated and a lot of the information I was able to obtain was from unreliable sources, or went against everything that I felt could be true after talking with the team and meeting them in person. Was GitHub just really good at making me think they were an awesome company, or were they really as awesome as they seemed to be, but never cared to tell people about it? 

After joining the team (one of the best decisions I have made in my career), I can now tell you with confidence that it is because word simply never got out about just how great being a GitHubber truly is. 

- Work with people who still have passion. With the flexible hours and unlimited vacation, I was finally able to join a team that not only worked hard, but had yet to be completely burned out. 
- Put your family first. GitHub gets it. We all have lived outside of work and they understand that these lives take precedent over something 9-5. They offer maternity and paternity leave, which I was thrilled to hear about. 
- Dogs at work. If you have a dog, this is heaven. If you don't, even better. You can play with someone else's and then say goodbye when you leave for home. 
- Flexibility with what you do and how you do it. Take on those additional projects and offer your extra time to different teams. They encourage cross team training and the company is small enough to make it a reality. 
- Remote but united. A lot of the company works remote, but with team summits and the companies annual summit, you get plenty of face time with the people you work with.
