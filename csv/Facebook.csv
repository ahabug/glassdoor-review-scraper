Definitely not an easy mock call. Not alot of my training class went on to continue working there. The work environment was relaxed, business casual dresscode required, but it just felt easygoing on the floor, not all high stress, high powered call floor where everyone is yelling sales stats and talking crazy to a potential client to get the sale. They continued on the job trainings as necessary. There were many opportunities for lateral moves, and promotions. Sadly, the reason I had to leave was because of a family emergency, that became an ongoing issue.","What was offered to potential clients may have been a bit too costly.

Which means no WLB. Many 15+ hour days in a month are common.
- Low growth: Hard to become a people manager in this company unless you’re really lucky.
- Leveling is a total mystery. People who advance are usually those whose managers are willing to give them a great review at any cost.
- Middle management is filled with old timers who've never worked anywhere else, or some people who probably got in because they knew someone. Decision making is horrible leading to a lot of teams with tons of churn and low morale.
- No patience to build lasting products. Projects that need nurturing are shelved and the only ones that continue are those that Zuck personally cares about. You have 6 months to show massive progress, or else your product is done. 
- Reorgs are as common as oxygen at FB. This causes a ton of headache to have to re-start every so often.
- Business has serious headwinds due to things like signal loss caused by privacy climate and anti-trust legislation.","- Do an audit of middle management and let go of people with terrible reviews.
- Find ways to grow product managers
- Focus on WLB of your PMs by hiring more, being more realistic on timelines.
- Invest more in long-term bets and stop re-orging every 6 months.

Facebook continues to focus on this area: whether it is providing internal tools to understand how we work, providing resources to learn more on resilience, mental health and work-life balance. Or training managers to be more responsive to employees experiencing burn out or stress. We'll keep continuing our focus to do even more here."

Sadly, I've seen BIPOC candidates get shortlisted, only to not make the cut for arbitrary reasons. 'Not a good fit' is a poor reason for someone who spent the time interviewing with us with a stella portfolio. I worry that teams are only bringing in certain candidates to meet some sort of quota or to appear ""exhaustive"" in their search, just so that they can hire another white person.

1. Surrounded by very smart, experienced people, who are top in their field

2. A lot of non-tech opportunities, esp. for those who are not SWEs such as folks in HR, Operations, Research, Recruiting, Branding, etc.

3. Supportive employee resource groups such as Black@ and BlackWomen@ which I found has helped me a lot as a black woman living in the Bay

4. Global cross-functional teams collaboration, and worldly impact of the work I do. I'm non-tech, and I still get to work with engineers and other orgs on projects and even get to hack with them in Hackathons!

5. Candid and tough conversations are carried out within the company among employees using Workplace, which have led to overall updates to policies, and also in the products and services we provide to people globally. It's not always pretty or easy to do (sometimes it can get bumpy); but the fact that we can have these discussions in our teams and from Zuck as a company means a lot to me, especially coming from my experience in the past where my leaders didn't even acknowledge current events and the plight of others.

6. Benefits and Perks! There are so many amazing benefits that have truly saved me-- medical insurance, mental health support through Lyra (for you and family members) have helped so much especially during Covid times. 

7. So many other things other than Facebook, Instagram and Oculus to work on! The company has grown and work that we do esp. in AR/VR keeps me excited to work here, as well as research that we're doing.","1. Sometimes moving so fast can caused projects (non-tech) to experience multiple iterations when a longer time line may have yielded a ""one-and-done"" result

2. Would love more diversity and people of color in higher leadership positions. 

3. With the increase in company size over a short span of time, I've notice that there are folks that are hired on that do not align with our mission and values. This can cause tension within the teams, and some managers do not address these head on.

4. On some occasions work week can be quite long, from my experience. When dealing with a global project with multiple stakeholders, hours of work can be a pain esp. when you're in late night meetings or early morning (i.e 1AM PST when with APAC for example.). I find this more of a given depending on your role however.","Let's go back to being leaders in tech and policies! When it comes to racism and systemic racism amongst people of color in the U.S., and groups, politicians that post false information to instigate, I don't think it should take us so long to action (i.e. Twitter banning /fact checking politician posts that are false... before FB did).",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Until we evolve our performance model, work will be focused on 6-month chunks and limit our ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams.",5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

No matter how big of a fish you have been in previous ponds, you will be a small fish here and have incredible space to grow. There is incredible freedom to pursue the projects you want in the way that you want as long as you can defend why they are important to the company. While less than it was in the past, there is incredible transparency and accountability from leadership internally. Your manager will support and promote you in a way that is unprecedented at most other companies. Most importantly, the work you do affects millions or billions of people - even seemingly tiny tasks like making the app update 1 second faster or tweaking a model to deliver 1% more interesting content can have a large positive impact on the world. While it doesn't always succeed, the company takes diversity and social justice seriously and it shows in project initiatives and hiring.","It's a big company with entrenched (if sometimes informal) power structures. As much as people try to be transparent, there are backdoor politics that affect your role and career that you might not learn about until much later, if ever. There will be constant pressure to specialize - many of the new skills I've developed here would transfer well to other big tech companies, but be wasted at a startup. Work life balance can go sideways quickly unless you protect yourself zealously. Even in the ""move fast (and we no longer say 'break things')"" culture there is a lot of pressure to not mess up in ways that affect the public negatively - even small mistakes in privacy or integrity have terrible negative effects on potentially millions of people.","Get way ahead of privacy and integrity trends - we're usually reactive to anything that affects the top line, we should do a lot more speculative research on ways to protect free speech, squash misinformation, and protect user identity - all at the same time, even though those things often trade off poorly.",5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

I think this is on purpose so you never notice your complicity in the bad things the company enables. They also compensate you well so it's hard to leave for a lower paying job. They also lied about the hours during my interview. First year expectations are for you to work extremely hard for 10-12 hours/day with little to no support. This is worse for people who come in at more senior levels. If you have a good job now, do not leave it to go to FB because of higher pay. I wish I hadn't.","The company pays a lot of lip service to employee wellness, but mid-level managers are always trying to justify their jobs by demanding new reports, plans, and strategies. This is made worse by the high turnover at various levels of management, meaning that every time a new manager comes in, they need to be brought up to speed. These operational tasks are so frequent with relatively no lead-time that long-term product work suffers enormously.

Gaslighting and abuse is rampant in this department evidenced by the rapid turnover and mismatched culture compared to the rest of Facebook. Managers are bullies and not inclusive especially if you do not fit the white, frat boy stereotype. If you do not drink the ""kool aid"" or atleast pretend to drink it, you will be ostracized.

You cannot be your authentic self at work. Not my circus not my monkeys","This is not HP or Cisco, this is Facebook.

- Disparate tooling ecosystem and preference for homegrown tools over enterprise tools (which has lots of positives, but in many regards it means reinventing the wheel and bugs)
- Siloed teams working on similar things, but not knowing of or talking to each other

The other main con is information overwhelm. As a social media company, Facebook is in a unique position to influence and have a stake in social issues that have global impact. For better or worse, that means divisive opinions in the world coexist and are surfaced within the walls of the company and all over our internal workplace.

Politics and turf wars - multiple teams are competing for ownership over the same decisions. Directors will employ their teams as pawns to gain turf and evaluate them on their ability to do so.

People treated as competition, not partners - FB will intentionally pit peers to out-do each other, seeing this as a motivational tactic.

Churn and turnover - as priorities, ownership, and methodologies change, those part of the prior regime are cast aside.

- Internal developer tools are a huge focus. Anything which slows developers down is fixed if possible.
- Very good internal mobility: bootcamp means you have a good deal of leeway in finding a team, and, after a year internal mobility is encouraged.
- Tons of opportunities to make millions of peoples' lives just a little bit better. Like it or not, Facebook's products are used by over a billion people worldwide. There are few places where improvements and fixes can have such a broad reach.
- Lots of intellectual challenges: There are many types of challenges in building products for billions of people: technical (scaling and perf), product (how do you make it useful for everyone), regulatory (how to not fall afoul of privacy regulations), security (how to minimize badness that happens due to the products), and more.","The biggest challenge facing Facebook right now is that it is simultaneously too big to run the way it runs now (with teams trying to fight for impact and all hacking on the same products), and too small to fit with the well-intentioned goals that Mark has for all of the ways that Facebook can help people.

A company without any strong sense of unifying purpose tends toward bloat and stagnation. It feels like this is the direction Facebook is heading.

Excellent health insurance 
Solid name recognition for future jobs
Top notch perks","Leadership moves from crisis to crisis to crisis. The attention focus is relatively short on the hot issue of the moment and that trickles down to every org. You can be working on the number 1 goal or project from Jan - June and knock it out of the park. Then by July everyone's attention has shifted and your work is no longer relevant. A lot of institutional knowledge is lost this way. 

The company skews young as well, so there are a lot of inexperienced people who want to make their mark/get their promotions and they work hard but don't get the guidance that would help them work smarter. The result is that some teams take ""done is better than perfect"" and ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" to another level, which can make work tedious. Almost everyone comes from elite schools and has great stats so some really lean in extra hard into making themselves stand out, sometimes in ways that aren't the most useful or healthy. 

There's also a hierarchy Technical people on top, then Business people (cause they make the money) then lawyers then everyone else. People in ops often are at the bottom of the totem pole.

Rampant turnover - Facebook hires overqualified people and places them in incredibly boring, tactical roles with very little growth. With that, my first six months on the job, I saw extremely high turnover, and not only that, but managers were angry, defensive and vengeful when people left their teams.
Management sells grandiose visions of their team to team members - Management always mentions that their team is the “best” and that we are more coveted than that team.” I realize this was management’s way of overcompensating for the lack of impact and boring nature of their team as well as poor retention issues.
Management thinks they’re perfect - When they receive multiple below average pulse scores, instead of trying to “solve” the underlying issue, in this case growth and fulfillment of their employees, they try to play detective and figure out who rated them poorly and then use it against them during performance reviews. You are not perfect, and you are not god.
People are blocked from transferring by managers and are retaliated against during performance reviews if they express interest to leave a team. I spoke to a guy who left my team for consumer hardware, and he told me had to go to HR because the manager took it so personally. I personally was retaliated against when I expressed interest to leave a team. Warning: you cannot have an open discussion with your manager about switching teams. Managers will take this personally and then retaliate against you in performance reviews claiming you are an under performer and not committed to their team. They would rather you leave the company, then transfer as this would reflect poorly on them.
Performance at Facebook is like a popularity contest. You have to talk up and chat with leaders in the company, “play the game”, and be well liked. Your rating is dependent on the number of advocates you have in the room.

1. Their interview panelists and hiring managers were all caucasians
2. They continue to hire caucasians 

Also, during the interview process the interviewers mentioned that take diversity very seriously. However, I’m a diversity candidate (born in Cuba, have an accent, and openly meme we of the LGBTQ community) and the 3 caucasians interviewers selected a white American born candidate instead. 

How can you avoid unconscious bias in a recruitment process when the ones interviewing and making hiring decisions are not from a diversity background?","Make sure that your words match your actions. If you care about diversity and inclusion, then start by giving diversity employees the opportunity to be part of the interview process. This will avoid bias and ensure alignment with your organization values. 

Don’t say that you care about a diverse and inclusive workforce when you continue to hire people with the same color of the skin as yours, they talk and behave like you. 

Be transparent with candidates from the beginning and provide them with qualitative and quantitative feedback so they can work on themselves and improve for future interviews. 

With that said, IF YOU ARE A WHITE CANDIDATE BORN IN THE USA AND YOU INTERVIEW WITH THE TALENT ACQUISITION TEAM IN CHICAGO, YOU’LL HAVE HIGHER CHANCES OF GETTING SELECTED.

Performance ratings are a bit too formulaic, and thus can be gamed to an extent; the system undervalues certain types of work (for example long-term, risky projects) that other companies would find valuable.

Traffic around the Menlo Park (MPK) HQ is atrocious. Parking is extremely constrained. Corporate shuttles are reliable and the route network covers a huge amount of the Bay Area and then some (there's even several daily shuttles to Santa Cruz) -- but the seats are often too narrow and uncomfortable.

I'll cover 3 topics, which interest most people:

1. Work - probably the most meaningful and impactful work you can do in your life IMO. It's incredibly challenging, and going to work feels like a mission.
You do things differently at FB, and you get to learn and explore many areas of true R&D, to eventually become a better engineer.

2. People - Kind, incredibly smart, helpful, trustworthy and fun!
I've been at FB for about 6 months now, but I never saw/experienced such a company DNA before with respect, gratitude, kindness and awareness to bias.
People here are remarkable. 

3. Benefits - fantastic! 
I don't know other places who offer such benefits in such scale. 
I'm sure there could be, but in general I think FB is probably at the top.","None.

Nothing is ever perfect. 
But I think this is pretty close.

0,0,0,23 March 2020,12:28:25,Horrible terrible company with worst culture, Software Engineer,"Cambridge, MA",Former Employee ,full-time, more than 3 years,65,"Free food, good salary, hype","At Facebook I got to know what ""gaslighting"" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"". This is part of this culture! 
There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. 
Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. 

Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. 
HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. 

Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking. I wish I never joined this scam of a company, a lousy swamp filled with ghosts who pretend to be humans!",,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,5.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

- The people I've met here are some of the brightest and kindest people I've met in the whole industry. Interviewing was like talking to friends.
- You will feel challenged and have lots of runway to grow.
- The internal tools you'll use are way better than most company's tools or even many commercially-available tools.
- The perks speak for themselves. I mean free food tastes so much better than non-free food.
- The pay is some of the best in the industry
- The team I'm on has great work life balance (it's ALL about the team you choose)","- It seems this company skews a little younger. So some perks and company nuances you might not care about as much like free laundry (no thanks, I'll do my own) and dinner served around 6pm (no thanks, I'll have dinner with my family at home).
- Compared to other big tech, you'll see there's more emphasis on you actually working from the office (but many work 1 day per week from home). COVID-19 might change this. Since that, we've been working from home for an extended period.

- More flexibility with office locations than traditional SWE roles (e.g. there's EE teams in Austin but no SWE teams)
- Hard to imagine a better place to learn and grow as an engineer

- Since traditional EE roles dealt more with things like Oracle development, you can get the feeling that EE is looked down on by SWE orgs. I think this is changing quickly as the role evolves and people realize the complex problems EE's are solving, but we're not there yet in terms of having the same 'prestige' as SWEs
- Deadlines can be tight depending on business needs
- It's on you to determine how much you want to work.

Everyone on the team is motivated, talented and open to new ways of work. The team is very collaborative and flexible. This makes everyone very good to work with - we all want to achieve great results while maintaining good work/life balance.

We get the opportunity to work on very impactful projects. In our area we support the efficient and accurate payment of many billions of dollars per year. It's a great responsibility.

One of the great things I love is being able to work on software engineering projects in Austin for Facebook. While they don't officially allow software engineers in Austin at Facebook, Enterprise Engineering work is super close to the work I did previously as a software engineer at Facebook in Seattle.

The growth in Austin for Enterprise Engineering is also a great opportunity for me and my team - we get to be the ones determining the work culture here for engineering.","Ramping up within the domain takes some time. I wasn't immediately knowledgeable about things like the general ledger, period close, accruals, balance sheets and the like. While these may not be the most interesting topics, I do enjoying how my work reduces the tedium involved and makes sure the Facebook business runs smoothly.

As a remote office, we do have to sometimes coordinate across time zones. It's not often, but sometimes it does require meeting in the evening.

It really depends on your team, Product Marketing,"Menlo Park, CA",Former Employee ,full-time, more than 5 years,8,"Facebook has a lot of Pro's but it really depends on the team you land on and the internal politics that surround that particular unit. That is no different than any other company but it can be night and day here.

Generally here are the Pros
- People: Majority of the other Facebookers are of high quality and surrounding yourself with other smart people can only up your own game.

- Benefits: Positive package here overall. They take care of your health, make some life task much easier and try to make life more comfortable.

- Technology: Innovative mindset is a big plus but recent years have been more mirror moves with competition to gain an advantage. Good move but for those that want to break the glass into new frontiers, you got to pick the right team.

Impact: The opportunity is there for you to embrace.","Generally here are the Cons:
- People / Culture: There is a small minority of leftist that can be loud and push activist agenda's that are in your face. While my own goals can align (leftist) I don't like their approach. This is just society creeping into the corporate world and is seen across Tech in general. It can be toxic and extremely disrespectful. You might find more of this at Facebook due to the nature of the product. Imagine the rest... Pick your team wisely.

- Weak Leadership: Lot of new leaders... Experienced leaders may not have much experience with trouble shooting negative situations and come in with a bias. Another point here is the number of Re-Orgs. You might experience multiple changes within a quarter / half and this can drag on for years. 

- Negative news cycle ... it can be draining but it should be a wake up call to further innovate for a product for today. However... this news cycle is long... I mean looooooong and can be intense at times.","Think longer than 6 month windows.

Employees are technically assessed on many aspects of performance, but the only one my manager focused on was lines of code.
- Competitive culture: Constantly talking about PSCs meant everyone on the team was afraid of any appearance that they did something wrong, which created a culture of blaming others and never admitting mistakes. Managers either stayed out of it or made it worse.
- Workload: My tech lead set deadlines that were too aggressive and didn’t listen when my teammates and I pushed back, so we were constantly behind schedule. Working late at night and on the weekends consistently was required just to remain a few months behind schedule.
- Asking for Help: Several members of my team had to ask for help writing code many times per day. Most of their questions could be quickly solved by typing a few words into a search bar and looking at the first result, but they still asked another engineer any time they encountered something they didn’t already know how to do.

Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. 

The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people.

My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee.

Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career.

The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas.

On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role.","As is the case with many large companies, some middle management fails to display leadership to a large extent.

The 360 was useless, management can use if they want to promote you, but if you are not in great terms with your manager, the 360 will be ignored. 

I was also told multiple times, the company is impact-based and that what matters is impact. After working on a project with another manager, I was told I could not get any credit, since it was not 100% my idea.","Put a proper 360 system where the rating does not depend100% on the manager and actually takes impact and peer reviews into account.

Understand that the conpany principles (e.g. Move Fast, break things, be bold) are not applicable in all sotuations.

Facebook rewards ambition.","The appeal quickly wears off. Your experience at Facebook highly depends on the team you join.

Facebook does not have the best people managers. If you join a team with a good manager who knows the system, you will be more likely to have a productive, prosperous time at Facebook. If you join a team with a bad manager, your work-life balance will be horrible. You will feel extreme pressure with the Performance cycle review every six months. Worse yet, you may even blame yourself for what's happening, not realizing the role your manager plays until it is too late.

Facebook is a good company for new college graduates. Even with a bad experience, you can learn so much about practical, applied technology here. For those with several years of experience, or with family commitments, be careful. Come into Facebook with a clear sense of what you need from Facebook that you cannot get anywhere else. Be prepared to leave when that is delayed, or not a possibility, or comes at a cost to your family or external commitments.

For most people, Facebook is not a company that you join and happily work at for the rest of your life. Facebook is a temporary stop that will squeeze as much productivity out of you as it can.

- Free Food
- Health Insurance but you'll need it due to issues this place causes
- Meet lots of cool people
- Good for your first job but if you are experienced coming from the outside be very careful as they don't value this.
- The FB experience varies widely between teams. I have friends who love their job and role on the team they are in. This wasn't the case for me. Your company is as good as your manager and I had no good ones.","1. Work/Life Balance
If you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams.

2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: 
(i) Managers fawning over each other showing ""impact"" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you.
(ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People ""strong arm"" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good.
(iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace.
(iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based
(v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done.
(vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary.

3. You are goaled a lot on ""collaboration"" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be ""happy"" and ""always on."" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system.

4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's ""XFN this"" and ""XFN that"" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on ""collaboration"" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be ""liked.""

I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture: The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People: Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management: Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.","Keep doing what you're doing and fight hard to not be complacent. I believe that humility is the key so don't ever lose that thinking. Your motives will always be suspect, but if you're able to look in the mirror everyday and know that your motives are pure, that's all that matters.

The meals provided are of good quality and are free as are the snacks that are provided.,"(I worked in the Austin, Tx office under the Community Operations organization)

Rampant hostile political atmosphere
Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward. This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone. This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions. No one wins.

Sloppy processes
It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes. Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives). Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work. So much waste. No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.

No humanity in the human facing part of the org
Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center. People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help. We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.

Custom everything means sloppy everything
So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be! Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.

Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people
Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period. It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience). The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook. It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly. There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops. There is only ""What's in it for me?"" 

HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock
You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position). I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details. Kind of disappointing. 

Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet
When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place. But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain. It's frightening given how much power and authority Facebook has and I really hope that this issue is sorted before things go to far.","Be mindful of what behavior you are driving given the way expectations are set
Take a hard look at what Facebook says it wants to do and what it's really doing- are they aligned?
For Community Ops- the org is there to support the users of Facebook- the humans on the other side. I'd encourage you to take a deep walk into the org to see if the individual members are really thinking of those people when they do their work.",3.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,5.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

Fast promotion if you can work long hours. 

Fast paced environment, you'll get to learn new stuff all the time. Lot of smart engineers around.","With fast promotion comes fast firing. It's up or out policy up to a certain level. 

Not a good place for senior engineers joining. Too much stress in the team driven by performance reviews, which is the most aggressive that I've ever known. Emphasis is on individual impact, due to which there's lot of distrust within the team. No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. 

There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication.

Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year.

This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired. Most of the engineers work to satisfy performance reviews. My work is determined keeping performance review as the guideline.

But company will be fine, lot of good engineers capable of quickly delivering a fix or hack a feature.",:),2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,4.0,3.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

0,0,1,22 November 2019,18:44:00,Shockingly Bad Experience,,,Former Employee ,full-time, more than a year,1,"Free food, tshirts, good pay, benefits","To me, the culture was deceptive and backstabbing, and my org lacked accountability for management practices and pathways to fix problems.","Disclaimer: This is my opinion, based on firsthand experiences and observations while working at the company. My situation may have been wildly different from that of other employees, but I can only review what I experienced. 

I think the company could benefit from promoting candidness among the workforce instead of relying on propaganda and groupthink. I'd also like to see Facebook hire outside consultants to clean house and remove clusters of horrible managers, employees, processes, etc. I'm not the first to say it: Facebook is no longer a quirky startup and should probably stop acting like one.

For me, working at Facebook featured the ""fake it til you make it"" scheming of Elizabeth Holmes mixed with the incompetence and denial of the USSR during Chernobyl... disguised as the paradise from The Good Place (spoiler alert, it's actually hell).

I felt that the job Facebook sold to me during recruitment simply didn't exist. Instead, my duties were embarrassingly ridiculous. I found myself working off-hours on non-essential tasks that any middle school student with no professional experience could have accomplished (seriously). The culture of blatant misrepresentation and kool aid drinking seemed so prevalent that I regularly saw new employees realize within weeks of on-boarding that they had been duped into taking nightmare jobs. The practice of awarding large relocation bonuses (which must be paid back if an employee quits before 1 year) seemed like a great perk but left unhappy employees unable to leave without owing huge sums of money. 

Though I was bombarded with slogans and propaganda from day one, such as ""feedback is a gift,"" it seemed clear to me that only sugarcoated, ""positive"" feedback would be tolerated. Management never wanted to hear about problems (though there were so, so many) and used some of the most creepy and passive aggressive fear tactics I've ever seen to keep employees' mouths shut about anything that wasn't seen as complimentary. This was not just my perception of the situation. I was outright advised by managers to only promote myself and omit anything negative in group settings to be seen as a team player. Why a company would expend massive amounts of money to hire industry experts, only to have them ignored, under-utilized, and treated like garbage by unintelligent managers was beyond me. 

It also seemed to me that it was not uncommon to see employees with greater education and industry (or even managerial) experience than their supervisors. More than a few managers also appeared to have poorly-defined and redundant roles. This created the worst type of dynamic, which Facebook encouraged employees to work around by ""managing up."" In other words, employees with greater skills or insight but no power were supposed to somehow make up for the shortcomings of their bosses.... an impossibility in a system that effectively operated as a rigid, top-down hierarchy.

To me, the vague leadership roles also caused managers to essentially have to compete with their reports for credit and attention, which could easily make the worst among them feel threatened and lash out. I witnessed managers gossiping in meetings to try and ruin their own employees' reputations (see below ratings section). It also seemed common for even mid-level management (who seemed to be constantly jetting around the world on useless self-promotion tours) to take low level employees' work and spin it into wildly inaccurate tales of success for personal gain. 

The rating and promotion system? I thought it was a joke of a popularity contest akin to the Black Mirror episode Nosedive. Management might not have been capable of providing any real feedback about skills or performance, but they wouldn't hesitate to let an employee know if he or she wasn't smiling enough or making enough cross-functional buddies. 

Everyone at the company was required to seek out performance reviews from numerous other employees twice per year, which I felt kept people behaving like phony robots incapable of constructive discourse. From what I could see, the system lacked objective standards or oversight, which stifled improvement and seemed to allow networks of awful employees to keep one another afloat. I was blown away by how many low performers managed to stick around and secure jobs for their extended network, spreading like a cancer.

To make matters worse, I did not find that the company had an effective system of checks and balances for bad managers, and it seemed like employees were usually too scared to leave honest reviews for their bosses or organizations during performance review cycles or climate surveys. Why? Because warnings from veterans of the company, the treatment of perceived ""troublemakers,"" and occasionally direct comments by management communicated that anyone who tried to rock the boat would be punished. Punishment in such a passive aggressive environment usually took the form of sudden and unexplained negative performance feedback (resulting in lower bonuses and probably a career tailspin), hateful gossip, extra busywork, and/or constant harassment and micromanagement by supervisors who would start finding problems with everything or requiring permission for even the smallest tasks. 

I've never worked somewhere where so many of my colleagues regularly burst into tears (or rages), either because they felt like hostages to bosses who'd have them working on useless, self-serving projects late into night, or because they felt their supervisors were trying to torpedo their careers or reputations behind their backs. These employees would then have to pull themselves together enough to smile at a meeting to avoid further negative feedback. In my view, it was truly a disgusting environment, at odds with the gushy pro-Facebook culture posters plastered everywhere. 

My advice to people considering working at Facebook would be to be very VERY careful about where you end up at the company. Do not ignore your gut or any red flags that pop up during hiring. Make sure the compensation and sparkly perks will be worth it in the event that you find yourself working insane hours on nonsense, being regularly demeaned by a knuckle dragger of a boss. If you live in the Menlo Park area, the money won't actually go that far, and your options if you hire onto a bad team may be nonexistent. You'd likely have to endure whatever abuse is thrown at you and reach a certain level of social impressiveness just to remain with the company long enough to switch to another team.

For me it starts first and foremost with the mission: to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. I love this mission and while I've worked in other great companies in the past with great missions too - this by far - is the mission that relates most to me as an individual. It's powerful. It's empowering. It's enriching. It's transformative. Not just for me but for so many people we share the world with today but also tomorrow. What I love about it is I believe Facebook and its family of apps: Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, etc, and other technologies like it from other companies are transforming the medium of language, the medium of communication. I can remember being a young boy in the early 80's in a small city called Waterford, in the south of Ireland, being excited when introduced to the humble CD for the first time. I remember clearly the first mobile brick hand-phones, mpeg players, ipods, on and on and on. With the advent of AR/VR and the proliferation global messaging apps that connect huge parts of the world today I'm feeling a similar excitement here seeing first hand the impact these technologes are having for billions of people on the planet. I'm really enjoying being in a company not just playing a huge part in this evolutionary transformation but doing so in a company from what I can see so far is doing so with real respect for its employees. The work environment is safe, collaborative and fair. There are large degrees of flexibility, autonomy and transparency. Folks are humble and authentic, at least the ones I've all met so far, and they deeply care about their work and those people around them. I'm only new, so I'll need more to understand the company as the weeks, months and years go by, but so far so good and I'm delighted to be joining at such an early stage of its growth.",None yet.

 1)Management: Inexpert management, really superficial and high level approach, luck of clear direction, unprofessional jokes and attitude, play favourites, only interest in their own goals and not the development of the team
- Lack of structure: No processes & structures, many teams have been created without a prior consultant opinion. So many people, me included, have been obliged to work in a team not fitting their skills.
- Not all the opinions are heard: If you try to propose new projects ideas and . process you can result annoying. They ask people of higher level to be independent and drive their own initiatives, but at the end the managers decide and promote only the people that help them to reach their own goals.
- Team collaboration: we are all great talent and characters, but the lack of job together with the managers inconsistency created un-healthy competition and back stubbing environment","- Please be more professional: We are not a group of friends!!! Bad jokes on the city where someone comes from or arrogant commenta are not acceptable in a great company as Facebook
- Work more on written processes and workflows that enable same expectations for everyone
- Improve People skills: start to listen the opinions of all team members, care more about their needs and their desire to growth and make things impactful and meaningful for them instead of thinking solely to your own interests!",1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,5.0,1.0,,,,,,

* Blame showers during incident reviews (and incident triaging).
* Over the fence handovers. Fake promises by recruiters, lack of leadership.
* Walls between orgs for transfers and artificial, per-org devopment limitations. It's better to leave and reinterview with a chance of getting better offer than trying to move internally (and still going through the interviews) and getting your level frozen for a year.

There's some efforts to improve engineering practices, but get smudged and diluted by the lack of will and understanding from the leadership, and the lack of reward from the global org (doing two really crappy things gives you more performance review points than doing something with high quality, and/or refactoring any amount of the crappy things around).","Rethink the way you work, hiring smart people is not enough to build awesome things, and burning engineers is no way to maintain a company, if you want people happy...",2.0,2.0,4.0,,2.0,5.0,4.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

This sounds incredible, but it's true. Decisions are taken as part of cross-functional meetings where everyone has an opinion and nobody is really driving. Somehow, it seems to work well because decisions ARE taken! But the downside is that it creates a lot of insecurity as people are really freaked out that things blow up (and it blows up quickly here, considering the regular negative media headlines) and that they be blamed. Managers in particular, are very sensitive, insecure and as a result, they tend to micro-manage or get involved in matters they shouldn't be involved with at their level. A lot of dissatisfaction about management all around. 

A lot of pressure to get the job done. You need to be resilient and work hard on preserving your work/life balance.

Very big and cool issues to work on, which you wouldn't fine any where else in the world due to the sheer scale of the company.","The internal career system seems well intended and fair at first, until you try to follow it.
Very poor work-life balance. I've never worked so much in my entire career, yet it never seems enough to satisfy the criteria to grow up internally.

All internal systems are custom made and many times they compare poorly to open-source alternatives, specially from usability and stability perspective. Which means you will spend a long time to master the internal tooling and all that hard-earned knowledge will be worthless when you leave the company.
Also, that all engineers have so much freedom means that everyone is constantly reinventing the wheel, and increasing the overall complexity of the environment thus changes harder and harder as time goes by.
This is exacerbated by the bonus system, which for many years has encouraged engineers to build and deliver new things rather than fixing existing issues.

All of this combined has lead to a monstrous internal ecosystem which is a huge pile of entangled hair, where the simplest of tasks requires careful planning and understanding and will take several days.

Management has lately changed the incentives to encourage fixing and better quality, but it's too little too late.","You need to take work-life balance more seriously.

big thinking: the company really discourages big thinking, they even write this in performance reviews. innovation is handicapped by the culture values. 
opportunities and risks: it is very easy to predict next steps within facebook whether it is an opportunity or a risk but senior leadership for some reason dont act on 90+% prediction accuracy. leaders should prevent risks from turning into massive issues and pursue obvious opportunities, but facebook wait till last minute and activate fire fighting, also too many missed opportunities. 
Fire Fighting: we are constantly in a reactive mode of firefighting, it blinds us from seeing what needs to be done. 
Planning: facebook is super allergic to ""planning"" as it is perceived to be a top down approach. we see multiple solutions to the same problem withing the same team as a symptom.
Slow Culture: within facebook every individual is super fast as there is freedom to what you want/can do, but it slows the entire machine pretty dramatically as there is no direction and we end up correcting course every month.
Decision Making: there is no process or methods on how to move the needle, it is all based on one's social likability. 
HR culture: HR is part of so many aspects in facebook more than any other american corporate. they created this toxic environment to be a single point of failure in most decision.
Bottom up approach: make people really dizzy as there is a lack of direction. unless you are an engineer, you will suffer badly.

- Impact. Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective.

- Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines. It's the fancy machine learning model that will earn you respect.

My technical title was substituted with a non-technical ""specialist"" equivalent that paid less, resulting in a 20% bump in my salary when left, despite downgrading from a ""lead"" level position at Facebook to a ""senior"" level position at my current job.
* Management is often promoted based on seniority rather than competence.
* ""Most fast"" mentality leads to duplicated work, lack of documentation, and general confusion. Senior ICs are expected to spend much of their time project managing to make up for the failure in organization. I often found during requirements gathering for a project that part or all of it had already been done elsewhere and everyone had simply forgotten about it.
* The culture of open communication makes it seem like employee feedback is valued and encouraged, but actions are rarely taken on that feedback.

- By default, almost everything you ship is used by a lot of people
- Benefits are really good","- You work all the time. It's impossible to truly step away from work. I had dreams about FB projects until about 3 months after I left.
- If you don't end up on a good team, or with a good manager, you're out of luck in terms of ""upwards"" movement and ""impact"". It's really a dice roll unless you're privileged enough to select a specific team.
- Facebook itself is a well greased machine. It self-enforces a lot of its own problems we're seeing the outcomes of today due to how it works. It's unlikely to change that anytime soon, so if you don't like how FB is unable to predict externalities in its work at its scale, you'll be upset working there
- Working at FB is a bit like having blinders on. You're so dang busy and shipping things all the time, it is not conducive for you to think about the big picture and (related to above) the potential butterfly effects/externalities of your work. Many well-intentioned projects end up having disasterous consequences, but I'm confident that 99% of people out there, if they worked on the project, would've also been unable to predict the fallout. The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render ""natively"" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface — it was lead by a product designer — and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line.","Facebook's culture will never change. The recent Q4 earnings are a testament to how good the ""ship fast"" machine is printing money. Even a disastrous 3 year long anti-FB PR cycle didn't keep the stock down for long, which means the company won't make major changes to the way they work.

Here are the more radical ideas that will never be implemented:
- Zuck needs to go, or step back into a different role to just focus on his pet projects (which he has many). His low EQ trickles down through the company because all important projects live or die by the ""Zuck Review"", which he offers his gut views on the product. The man is not infallible, and cannot predict bad human behavior because he himself (and those around him) are only human, and have many flaws and oversights due to their background, location, wealth, etc.
- Build more ""local"" product teams. FB to this day insists on running product from HQ, whereas Lays and Doritos know that their American flavors will never work in Southeast Asia and create local flavors with a local team and local testing. Line is a Korean company that has a Thailand specific team to work on Thailand specific features. Facebook has never done this except for a ""project Japan"" to make FB more appealing to Japanese people in the late 2000s/early 2010s.
- Fire a ton of people. There is a lot of incompetence, especially at the management level

They weight internal/external folks the same. 
- work life balance is not great, but you don't come to facebook to ""Cruise"" if you do, you will be fired quickly 
- Newer PMs from other companies seem to be infiltrating a ""CEO"" role in their job -- which is not how Facebook operates. Collaboration > dictatorship of features and product. 
- The product specialist role specifically is challenging to stay in for longer than a few years -- the bar for performance gets higher, but you have the same ""quiver"" of tactics and tools and can only reinvent the wheel so much. 
- Many teams don't understand your role or respect it much, which is problematic because a lot of your impact comes from your ability to push changes and improvements through EMs, PMs and other product focused teams.","- Allow internal candidates some advantages to changing roles or functions within reason -- we have the data and performance history to make the right decision. 
- Management needs more accountability. Anytime a project didn't ship or a team didn't do well, the leadership had a tendency to deflect blame on PMs, EMs and other ICs rather than leadership.

Speaking with a number of employees who left Facebook only to return once again, while no company is perfect, there is a lot that Facebook has to offer - not just in terms of benefits, but with the impact that our apps and services have on this world - for people and businesses alike. 

Our open culture is pretty amazing to understand the vision of our company and where we're heading. Leadership has been consistently transparent in ways that many other companies are not - even other tech companies - with weekly Q&As, open posts, and quarterly all hands. And they address tough issues or topics head on. 

There are a lot of career opportunities within the company - as we often refer to the ""jungle gym"" that you can take your career internally. There are incredibly passionate people who work at Facebook, and I never cease to be amazed by the level of intelligence and care demonstrated by my coworkers around the world to help our company deliver on our mission.","Particularly as of late, Facebook has been subject to a lot of negative press. While some of it may be deserved, a lot of it feels sensationalist. So employees have to develop a thick skin and resilience to a lot of this scrutiny and ensure that we are focused on the long-term, not just the short-term.

I appreciate it especially when I compare myself to my peers in other companies. We get paid very competitively and the perks are amazing. The job itself is rather interesting as well. I love the very caring and chilled atmosphere in the office - coming from consulting, no overtime and no extreme pressure is really a big difference. Most of the people in the office are quite smart and really fun to work with. I also love how international the Dublin office is, before joining I didn't see it as something very important but now I understand why everyone from FB keeps mentioning that.","- The constant talk about growth. Facebook is not growing as fast as it used to, yet the company hires like crazy. To be honest I think this is too much at this point. All these people are doing ""projects"" but these projects are in 3/4 not useful at all. The sole purpose of them is that someone can write it in their performance review but no one really uses the outcome of the project after that. 
- Despite the management saying how international the company is, every decision is still taken by Americans/British/Irish and according to their worldview. Which sometimes has awful effects on the company image in countries that were not part of the Commonwealth or are the US. It's particularly visible when there is a PR fire in American or British media, they can change something overnight based on that not thinking about how it will impact other parts of the world. Also it's worth mentioning that a huge majority of managers is Irish/British, and there is little internal mobility for non-natives. 
- Performance review is somehow not fair. Technically there are career expectations but if you fulfil all of them, you'll get the lowest score. There are people from certain parts of the world that would be working 16h a day (I'm thinking East Asia in particular) to get the best score so then people from other parts of the world need to work longer as well, otherwise their achievements will look pale compared to those working overtime. And performance assessment, potential promotion and bonus, are based on your place on the curve rather than on whether you fulfilled criteria of your job. 
- Internal mobility rules are very unfair. As an external applicant you'd meet and even exceed all the criteria for a particular role but if you are internal you cannot move to a role that is higher grade than yours. This leads to a situations in which people who applied internally were rejected, left the company and were soon approached by recruiters for the very role on LinkedIn if they'd be interested.","Committing so much to Dublin was not a good idea. Ads revenue is increasingly being taxed in other countries anyway. The other reason - ""access to great talent"" - is somehow flawed given that most of people are sourced outside of Ireland anyway. And given how unattractive and expensive Dublin is, some departments are getting over 50% decline rate from candidates because good professionals know housing in Dublin is a big problem (both to get it and the quality of it).",4.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

- Internal politics have drastically increased. There is a growing focus on optics vs. impact, which is incompatible with a culture that operates under ""Focus on Impact.""
- I found it difficult to express the company's values such as Be Bold and Be Open in a couple of organizations, because leaders who were external hires brought in a hierarchy, a ""CYA"" culture, and a combination of empire building and swim lanes.
- The culture in some organization is toxic – people feel unsafe voicing their opinions and being their authentic selves.
- Many teams find themselves blinded by metrics, still doing good work but missing the greater opportunities by ignoring clear paradoxes between metrics and customer experience.
- Internal transfer policies can be restrictive due to restrictions around leveling and performance. I know at least three people who left the company who wanted to move to a role that better suited them, but could not because they weren't meeting expectations in their current role (that didn't suit them).","- Spend time getting house in order – Build trust. Identify and remove toxic leaders throughout the organization, Meet with every employee to get pointed, specific feedback on team culture/management. Sure up buggy systems/processes before trying to launch the next feature or bring the next billion people on board.
- Don't attribute current political/data issues as the chief cause for employee attrition. The annual internal survey doesn't quite capture some of the cultural and operational frustrations that employees hold.
- Add more standardization to exit interviews – give them significant weight. This is an opportunity to learn the specific issues that are leading people to leave.

There is zero tolerance for an employee who expresses concern over a reorg which has been decided overnight, or over a change of job description/duties. 

Management encourages you to fake happiness, and to pretend everything is working perfectly. Important communications happen on workplace and not in person, you know for fear of not giving the perfect fake answer... and you just need to smile and keep working. 

There is no structure whatsoever! Everyone does whatever they wish to do, and when it comes to performance evaluation, you simply fake that too. 

Employees are in competition with each other, stealing projects and taking credits for work they did not do, and if you dare to share constructive feedback about a colleague then you should be prepared to seeing HR shortly. 

There is no long term strategy at this company, the product team keeps shipping products for the sake of shipping products without stopping and reflecting at the impact this is going to have on advertisers, and if something goes wrong it does not matter... after all it is better to move fast than doing the right things.. 

If Facebook wants to survive its biggest crisis, it needs seriously solid structure to grow, and should work on fixing all the mess made up until now. 

I am so disappointed by this company, instead of thinking of making more money, think of how you can really improve the product and create a positive work environment.","Structure, structure, structure.

But don’t get it twisted! All the free food, snacks, drinks etc. are made to keep you at work longer :)","Looking back at my experience there, I can clearly see that I was unfortunate to end up in a team that I was in. The fact that no one internally wanted to move to that team should have alarmed me, but having just moved to FB I didn’t think of leaving that early. Internally, people were very open about how they would rather quit than join our team. I figured that’s the reason why they hired a complete new team, instead of just moving some people around. 
 
However, people at FB are generally blinded by the perks and the status of the company. They make themselves believe that they are happy, but in reality everyone is constantly anxious. They just learn to cope and make it feel normal. 

The pressure is HIGH and the workload tremendous. Because of the amount of silly meetings that you can’t say no to, you will end up spending more than 50 hours per week to make sure you are up to speed. Some people at FB told me that work consumed every second of their life (they just couldn’t switch off). I knew of other colleages that they come in on a Saturday to do some extra work, and some dedicate their Sunday evening on projects to add to their internal CV. 
You can’t really switch off, at least not before 9PM. So, if you’re in a relationship/have kids, don’t go there. As a single person I felt bad for my colleagues with a family.

In my situation, and I also speak for the rest of the team, there was no support, no proper internal onboarding and literally no one around to be able to inform you what the general expectations were. It’s all very performance driven, so you have to Build up that amount of work you do, cause everything gets tracked. They don’t care how you do it, just do it. This explains why people work throughout the weekend to make sure they hit a certain amount of finished tasks for that week before the new week starts. You will be compared to Peers on your level, so it’s important to make sure you hit at least average to receive some bonus after your review. 

We had a new manager starting a few months after us, and hierarchy was the management style. Having anything to say went against the manager’s principles and clearly we weren’t liked. So were other colleagues of other teams not liked by this manager, because of their opinions. Be mindful of what you say...not everything is appreciated. 
At FB, managers are more valued than IC’s and they rather keep a bad manager than a good IC. So please be careful and try to make your manager your friend, trust me it will help you. 

They have amazing trainings on how to manage bias, but in all honesty, everyone was biased. The way they hired people, they way they treated people and the way they rated each other. During the annual performance cycle, you would only ask feedback from the people you had a good relationship with to help you get your bonus. 

Up until now, FB was the least favorable experience for me. I only say ‘worst experience’ when I talk to friends. They saw the negative impact it had on me working in a toxic environment. 

I do want to say that 2% genuinely loves working there, unfortunately the majority doesn’t.","Be fair, honest and be better managers. Look at your team and listen to them.

If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting:
 As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering. Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering. You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does. Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.

2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles. Also, be prepared for mansplaining.

3) more money than sense: gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around. there's basically an offsite every other week. Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing. The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.

4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers. no, seriously. say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away. you are kicked off the team and put on another team. what sense does that make? new mom wants to wfh? not allowed. 
 Seriously, it's called skype, people. 

5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack. instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project. a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project. This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.

6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken. I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly. bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix. seriously? why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?

7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance. no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom. What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE. Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why. But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.","separate managers from IC. some of the best people I have ever worked for were not programmers.

stop focusing on impact, it sounds like a colon and its utterly meaningless

if it's broken, fix it. if your metrics change as a result, deal with it.

build a real team structure, and provide some actual leadership.

- global reach and impact

At Facebook, you have the opportunity to work on products that everyone uses. This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisions—unpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages.

They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the “Facebook 15” is real). The company’s health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus.","- politics and back channeling 
- competitiveness and lack of collaboration 
- relationships hold more value than quality work

Facebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes what’s really going on under the surface. People act like it’s all sunshine and roses, but because there’s such a “focus on impact” and performance, it’s actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibility—at Facebook, visibility > impact > high performance ratings > bonus multipliers + equity refreshers. 

As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though you’re told to “be your authentic self”, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, don’t rock the boat, and are oftentimes male.

While the actual benefits and perks are great, don’t be fooled by the glamour of it all: they’re also designed to keep you there and keep you working. You’ll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. There’s an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged.

Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If you’re a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesn’t matter how much experience or expertise you have—I spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing. 

Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, “Nope!” Time and again, when I’d go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, “That’s the one!” After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, “I’m tired of (and better than) this.”","You hire people for their expertise, so let the use it.

—-

Today marks my first year at Facebook. We call it a Faceversary. And, while celebrating your work 
anniversary might seem a bit frivolous (or at least I thought so early on), I quickly learned to appreciate the FB tradition that’s built around these Faceversaries. It’s valuable to reflect on all that happens in a year at work, considering how much energy, time, and effort we put into it. 

When you make it to your 10-year milestone (my count down starts now), you get the opportunity to join Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others on the management team to tell a 10-year Faceversary story to the entire company. Those are always funny or emotional, or both. 
 
So, what can I share after my first year here? 
 
TL;DR: Work with and learn from the very best people. Drinking from the firehose and learning a ton. Autonomy, authority and support. World-class benefits. Open culture to the bones. An inside look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. Five core values in action. Pretty darn happy. 
 
I get the pleasure to work with incredible, impressive, and talented people daily. Both within the walls of Facebook, but also with clients and partners who are working on some unbelievable things. My pod and my core team are just legendary. This isn’t lip service. I really get to work with and learn from the very best. 
 
I’ve learnt SO MUCH. About digital advertising and marketing. About financial services. About media. About other industry verticals I previously knew nothing about. About navigating complex circumstances. About working for a company that’s constantly in the spotlight. About digging deeper to really understand. About cross-functional collaboration. About partnerships. About technology. And much more. Internally, they say every day at Facebook is equivalent to a week. I now know why. 
 
I have the autonomy, authority, and support I need to be successful and run my marketing consulting business the way I see fit. Further, I get to shape and influence how businesses engage, nurture, and build new relationships with people.

I have access to incredible benefits that I’m astonished by daily and so grateful for. In fact, I’m writing this post while on paid paternity leave to spend time with my family and our new addition, Logan. 
 
Facebook fosters an open culture that is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Mark hosts a weekly company-wide Q&A where he addresses thoughtful and difficult questions about a wide-range of issues and opportunities. Everyone, from Interns to tenured employees, are welcome to ask anything and they don’t face judgement or criticism for raising difficult topics. On our internal Workplace (Facebook for Work), I can join and learn about a whole host of interesting projects, regardless of whether I’m involved in them. 
 
I’ve learnt a lot about both the harmful ways and the incredibly positive ways Facebook can be used. I get a firsthand look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good.

There are 5 core values that guide how we work at Facebook. And I see them in practice regularly. Build social value. Move fast. Be bold. Be open. Focus on impact. 
 
I’ve always been fortunate in my career. I’ve worked on amazing teams, on fascinating projects, with inspiring mentors and leaders. Facebook has been a continuation of that for me. But, I must say, I’ve never been this happy. 
 
So, here’s to one amazing year and the many more to follow!",The bar has been set so high for any future employer to be within my consideration set. I’m truly spoiled.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Office spaces are nice, the benefits are really good, plus they continuously update their 'Life@' perks which can be handy and convenient.","The worst part about Facebook is the culture. With the excuse that you should 'focus on impact', people will fight for 'sexy' projects and things that will obtain them a good performance review. Since middle and upper management often do not have a clue about what their own teams actually do, whatever you can make sound important (e.g. with fake metrics or tales of potential impact), you are onto a winner. Unfortunately, the same managers do not enforce a culture of fairness or trust; instead, it is a culture of rewarding back-stabbers and people who 'get the work done' but who, at the same time, treat their colleagues poorly. By that, I mean stealing projects or not giving credit to those who get the work done, for example. It is an awful environment to work in. Some teams are worse than others as well: You could end up reporting into a bad apple who steals projects from you. It happens, and it happens often.

Good people managers are never rewarded, as people management is not something Facebook recognises as important. Yes, in the orientation they will give you a big speech about it but when was the last time good people managers got promotions? Managers should focus on people, and ICs should focus on things. Unfortunately, bad managers who are good at IC work get rewarded often to the detriment of their teams, who have to suffer under people who should have never become people managers. The so-called Pulse survey is a joke, as no importance is given to low-scoring managers. If 10 people in a team say they would not work with their manager again, something must be wrong, don't you think? 

To any potential employees: Do not get fooled by the appearances. Facebook makes people feel trapped because they make you think this is the 'best' company and that you should be grateful you are part of Mark Zuckerberg's dream of making the world more 'open and connected'. It's a fallacy. Do not fall for it.","Upper management need to pay more attention to the people under them, and make their managers accountable. It is too easy to hide bad things at Facebook, simply because Directors and VPs are too busy trying to make their pyramid schemes even larger. 

HR need to be more people-focused, as they don't support non-managers, even when you have genuine issues. They will always protect and engage with managers, so if you have issues, well... you are better off not asking your HRBP, as they will simply say they are too busy for your minuscule needs.",2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

0,0,0,22 May 2018,05:52:17,Evil company run like a criminal gang, Software Engineer,"Cambridge, MA",Current Employee ,full-time, more than a year,100,Salary (to offset the rest),"What took me two years to understand is that this company is run like a criminal gang. They do not value technical expertise as much as loyalty and subordination. This is a brutal world (remember: criminal gang!) where people are punished frequently for unrelated reason and for no reason whatsoever, and always kept under pressure, sense of fear and uncertainty.

The most disgusting thing is lies. Management lies through their teeth, about everything! They create alternate reality, to justify everything they do. 

They do stack ranking: 15-18% is targeted not to meet their expectations) - they lie that they do not do that. Compared to Amazon which targets 5%, this is horrible.

At lower levels (IC3-IC4) they have up-or-out: either you get promoted or you get fired. IC5 level is considered (which is a lie) to be ""very very senior leadership"". When you look at the distribution, more than a half of engineers are IC5+. Given the fact that IC4s are expected to perform consistently at IC5 level in order to be promoted (so they are effectively IC5's), we get a whopping 85% employees being ""senior leadership"" - it's disgustingly evil. It results in the most toxic work environment I have ever experienced in my career. 

Facebook operates in a ""burn-out mode"": they hire fresh meat, squeeze every drop of juice out of them by overworking, then fire them when they are exhausted. Their model of employment is not sustainable by definition (and is implemented via stack ranking, as well as other tools).

Employees are held at a constant state of stress. I've seen employees crying in the office, in front of management. 

Management mastered an art of vague flip-flopping: no consistency, no responsibility whatsoever. 

Top management supports this authoritarian criminal pyramid: nobody got fired as a result of recent scandals of data leaks, top VPs were only moved around. Scandal was covered with lies.

The hyped-up parental leave is only a PR stunt and a lie: for taking it one gets performance review downgraded. 

Endless semi-mandatory hackathons to further drain your energy. Oh, there is also a measure of counting ""thanks"" you got during last half a year. If you don't get enough thanks, that's an excuse to downgrade your performance. I say ""excuse"", because there is a huge leeway for a manager to justify any rating at PSC. All performance manager's feedback is vague and non-actionable.

Very few people take vacations, due to peer pressure and fear. 

Everybody whom I talked to were stressed and unsure if they would be employed in 6 months. 

I wonder where they manage to hire such a low-integrity people. Especially HR: they are the kind of people who just wait for their despot to come to power when they gladly start sending people to Gulags. There is nothing humane about these atrocious individuals.

Facebook lies about supporting freedom of speech. In fact, internally you can get easily fired over saying something quite benign. People complain a LOT to management and HR - for minute reasons. A lot of tell-tales for which they occasionally fire without explanations.

Finally, Facebook's business practices are quite questionable at best.

Among ICs they foster the culture of subordination, impostor syndrome. I guess this makes sense, because this is the only way to cope with Dunning Krueger management.",You should go to prison.

As an individual contributor myself, I really appreciate having a caring and at the same time professional manager, who gives me a lot of flexibility, but steps in when I need them.
- You are being recognized for impact, not for how many years of experience you bring to the table. This helps getting good reviews for hard work, even when you're young and unexperienced.
- You get many opportunities to work cross-functionally, which is great for diversity of thought. Personally, I like the fact I am exposed to working with technical and non-technical people.
- Some of the benefits are amazing. Fertility treatment coverage and in general medical coverage are the best out there.","- Facebook purposefully hires very smart and ambitious individuals. Even when there's no pressure from the manager to work long hours, you often see people working long hours, which in return puts more pressure on you.
- There are no incentives to stay in the company for longer than 4 years. Once you vest all your RSUs, refreshers you get for good performance look very unattractive. It's more and more common for people to leave FB after 4 years, and come back a year later to re-negotiate their RSUs.
- You are being ""punished"" with certain benefits if both spouses work for Facebook. A good example is baby cash which you get per family, not per employee.

There are many professional development opportunities to allow you keep growing. The perks could be a pro like free food, laundry, salon, etc. but I personally found it to feel like the company wants to keep you there instead of going home and having social interactions with people outside of Facebook. But, if you don' t have a strong social support network, it's a great set up. My co-workers were by far the best part of the company!","The hiring process is very strange as they hire people without knowing what team they'll be on, allowing for an opportunity to be placed on a team that's not a great fit, and then being stuck in it and not being able to move around until at least a year in. HR seems most concerned about protecting the company rather than really listening to employees and their concerns. There is a lot of turnover lately...I had 4 managers in about a 9 month span, which leads to really confusing situations. They also keep bad managers in their positions, even if there have been multiple concerns raised about them from a whole team. The values the company promotes are great in theory, but I don't see them in practice.","Promote middle managers internally - the more you bring external hires in, the more the company culture erodes, as these external people are stuck in their ways and not willing to do things the Facebook way, and the way ICs are told to expect things in bootcamp creating a total misalignment between expectations and reality. Also, when you know someone is a bad manager, remove them for the situation instead of allowing them to continue to lead their team astray or throw their ICs under the bus. After all, managers have the ability to have more positive or negative impact than an IC, but they have multiple safety nets built around them to protect them whereas ICs are on their own. Lastly when employees indicate they're interested in moving teams don't ask them to weather the storm for another 6 months in hopes that the next manager will make things calmer - listen to what they are experiencing that's making them want to switch teams and have a more appropriate work/life balance and a better experience with their manager.",3.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,5.0,4.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

0,0,0,17 March 2014,21:26:11,"Open, fast, no bs", Software Development Engineer,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,full-time, more than a year,439,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",You need to focus on how you are going to maintain the existing culture and protocols as you grow.

The role of a sourcer and recruiter is becoming smaller and smaller. And although leadership insists they care, every action they take suggests they do not. It is hard to constantly be reminded that you are merely just another number to be replaced asap. 

Be prepared to work long, long hours. There isn't such a thing as ""work/life"" balance as most in recruiting will work into the night and weekends.

Strong aspects of the culture
Openness of Mark Zuckerburg","Incorrect understanding and execution of the company values:
Value: Done is better than perfect - the incorrect interpretation is that done and perfect are mutually exclusive, no-one wants to do anything that is perfect.
Value: We [managers / leaders] are non-directive - incorrect interpretation is that managers do not need to provide direction, the result is that manager are ineffective and simply try to please employees.
Value: Make an impact - incorrect interpretation is any impact is a good impact, the actual impact of this is that there is little significant impact.

The company has many conflicting ways of working, for example the short term review process and the want and need to take risks and innovate. The result is that employees do not want to take long term risks as they will be penalised in their next review.

There is a PIP (personal improvement plan) process to help those underachieving to get back on track. This is only effective at removing people from the company and during new manager training (FME) managers are informed that most people (>80%) that are placed on a PIP leave the company. At the same time the company prides itself on the ability of employees to have tough conversations (Crucial Conversations is a class employees are encouraged to attend) yet no-one has these tough conversations. There is a reliance on processes such as the PIP process to remove people from the company rather than having direct conversations.","Start again with managers. The role of a manager is ineffective due to a belief that Facebook is different. Facebook is different to many companies but you can learn from other companies.

I don't regret joining FB:

- I've learned an incredible amount about a new tech stack and product management for ads in only a few months. Not all my peers are brilliant about all things (which is good, as I'm certainly not) but every one of them is smarter than I am about at least one thing, and it takes very little time to find out what. 

- Data and logic rule here -- not always, not entirely, but enough. There is enough of a culture of rigor to metrics that we still have a North Star when in the weeds.

- The perks are great. I have gotten broken glasses fixed by the dry cleaner for only a low tax rate. The food is shockingly good for the scale of the cafes, and I'm impressed every day by the whole MPK service operation.

- Workplace is much better than emails as a site for debate/discussion about what to do. Also a con, because it generates a game of how-should-i-react-on-Workplace all its own, and in a more public record.","Facebook is like Bitcoin: people in it ask when you bought in because it's the easiest way to find out how powerful you are without being rude. 

I joined within the last year, along with about half of the company. The contrast in the level of success of people who joined N years ago vs N-2 years ago is logarithmic for all values of N. At its current rate, I don't think I can advise anyone to join now, and after I vest, I'm not sure I will stay.

Part of this is that the starting comp isn't very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year.

The much greater share of it is that opportunities scaling in the same pyramid-growth path means that anyone thinking of joining today can't expect any of the same trajectory that available 2 years ago, and maybe even 1 year ago.","Most brutally, to many of the leaders in Ads and elsewhere: Your job is to set strategy and standards, ask aggressive and important questions in reviews, debug high-level problems before they hit the front page of the NYTimes, and find the right resources for your teams. It's not to write leadership manifestos about how to feel inspired. People will upvote soft memos when they're posted, and there's a growing culture that feels they have to to be on your good side. Fight that temptation and show that intellectual rigor and shipping impact, not pandering, still holds the day.

In so far as your job is to lead culture, it's also to build a culture that values people for their experiences *before* Facebook. In a company growing this fast and hiring at the middle, not just the bottom, we will have to agree that outside experience matters, or new employees will waste months if not years earning their stripes to prove their code and analysis and strategy and diffs are credible, too. And while there is onboarding time for everyone, this period is navigated alone here much more than it is in hierarchical organizations with mentors/mentees, year cohorts, other structures to force learning, and this lack will be more and more unsustainable as hiring accelerates over the next years.",3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,5.0,3.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

* Really awesome internal tools
* Unbelievable compensation & perks
* The company trusts & believes in its employees
* You become associated with the Facebook brand
* Also a con, but you have a ton of freedom in what you work on","The tl;dr is Facebook is a big company and its cons reflect that. The company mission and values are incredibly admirable, but have become increasingly difficult to implement as the company has grown.

* You might find yourself working on a project with over a million lines of code, but nobody on your team has written more than 10,000. The need to sit down and figure it out yourself can be pretty stressful in an environment that is pushing you to ""make an impact"" and be constantly shipping new features. 
* The few senior engineers (in my org at least) show little interest in mentoring more junior engineers.
* Sink or swim mentality among engineers, the mega-teams supporting products in the core app can be brutal and unwelcoming.
* Launch decisions are very political - criteria for launching a change is opaque, and feedback from department leads happens far too late in the development process (often in the meeting where a launch decision is being made!). Little has been done to fix these issues despite it being constant feedback for the past year.
* Performance reviews put too much emphasis on immediate personal output rather than collaboration and assisting other teams. This causes teams and individuals to focus inwardly. While it's never been malicious, I've seen this behavior directly harm other team's productivity or metrics.
* Work/life balance is below average on the day-to-day, but oncalls are truly awful.
* Decision-making has become a bit too distributed between orgs and reflects in the overall product.","* Pay close attention to teams that have poor retention and take drastic measures to reverse the vicious cycle (the less seniority on a team, the faster the turnover rate becomes)
* I think there is a gap between what's best for the company and what is rewarded in performance reviews.

- Sheryl Sandberg. A thousand times.","- If you land in the wrong team or are a victim of poor management, HR will not do anything about it, even if you have evidence. Firstly, they are severely understaffed (one HRBP per 200 managers?). 
- The feedback cycles are too political. This is one of the worst things about Facebook. It has 'imported' bad habits and bad people from other companies who brought their corporate baggage with them. It didn't used to be like this. 
- People work on projects based on their six-month feedback review, not what's good for a team or the company. The lack of accountability from upper management makes this much worse. People get promoted for 'inventing' things that get abandoned after a month. 
- If you are good at public relations but do nothing, you can get very far at Facebook. It means you have 'visibility'. It's poisonous. 
- It has become so cynical that the latest 'trick' to get someone promoted to director is for them to organise a 'global' gathering. In other words, bring a bunch of people to Menlo Park, say it's for team building and give it a funky name or a motto... and boom! They become a Very Senior Person.
- Zero work/life balance. You must be available 24/7.","ACCOUNTABILITY! There is a huge gap between directors and VPs and the rest of the company. They don't get told about issues, or the information is withheld until it's too late. The hiring spree is creating empires as more and more people are being added under the management layers.

This is a newer feature of our performance management program so hopefully you see this resolve some of the issues that you mention related to time-bound impact.

I'm given full autonomy to pursue the things that I think are most important. My team is incredibly diverse (including transgender, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino, and an unusually high percentage of women) which shows both an extraordinary commitment to diversity and gives me faith that the product will be built to serve diverse customers. And the backgrounds of the people on my team are shockingly elite, with many projects on their resumes that are immediately familiar to and admired by me. I'm also proud that Facebook has so many people at the very top who are strongly committed to VR - like Zuckerberg's ambitious announcement at OC4 that his goal is to have a billion people in VR.","Facebook is hugely committed to transparency and authentic identity.

Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you.

0,0,0,5 December 2017,22:39:17,Best Large Tech Company Culture, Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,full-time, less than a year,5,"From the start, Facebook has been amazing.

Bootcamp was a great experience; not too many companies let a new grad spend 6-8 weeks searching for a good team fit. They let you pick a team, which essentially means you get to pick your tech stack (Backend; Front-end; Mobile; Infrastructure), the org you work for (Messenger, Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, etc.). More importantly, you get to pick your manager + team mates, where as in other large companies, it's the other way around; you are assigned to a product & org & manager whether you like it or not. This is way different compared to Google's opaque 'host matching' process and Microsoft where they just randomly place you in a division like Azure or Office.

The company values really shine through every day. Before Facebook I thought the concept of company values was kind of corny and B.S. Now that I'm at FB I can at least say that here the company values are actually values held by top management + majority of the workforce and not just marketing / HR speak.

Everyday I really feel like we are moving fast and shipping a lot of product very quickly. We A/B test lots of features, analyze the data, and swiftly decide what to ship to the public. I never feel stuck; I always feel like I'm either implementing an A/B test or analyzing data so we can ship more features. There are not long product cycles with lots of prognostication from product leadership; we build, measure, then learn. Thats it.

I feel everyday that we have an open culture. At Facebook, we use Workplace, a tool thats kind of like Facebook but for corporations, made by you guessed it... Facebook. Within Workplace, just like normal FB, there are a ton of groups. I'm in a bunch of groups and basically get visibility on decision making + product updates + news from every part of our org. I feel like I'm in the loop and just learn so much about FB / product by reading my Workplace newsfeed. For example, today I read a research report about internet users in India, learned some stuff about dynamic ads, and saw one of the senior leaders announce a new partnership deal. All of that info isn't directly relevant to my day-to-day job, but because its all there and open to anyone, I learn so much and have so much clarity into FB's product vision & company objectives. Mark or Shreyl do Q & A's every Friday. Between hearing top leadership speak, and reading updates from every part of the company on Workplace, I feel that FB is a very open and transparent place to work.

There are many other pros and cultural values that I like but let me get to a major pro to end this review. Food!
Here's just a sample from today! I ate these 3 meals today at the company cafe 2 mins walk away from my desk. 

Breakfast: 
Soft Boiled Egg + Been + Cheese + Salsa Tostada. Organic Blueberries & Blackberries. Hemp & Pumpkin seeds.

Lunch:
Vegetarian Pho with Sous Vide Eggs, Tofu, Steamed Cabbage, Green Onions, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts in it. Added Sriracha and Chili Oil to spicen it up.
Thai Iced Tea Bobba (Bubble) Tea. 

Dinner (today was Jamaican themed):
Sweet Potato & Corn Casserole, Collared Greens, Fried Plantains, & Quinoa. 
I also got a slice of cheese pizza :)

Dessert: Mango Cheesecake made with Graham Cracker Crust. 

By the way, the menu rotates, and at the HQ, there are a ton of cafes to choose from so way more options for food are there.","Work life balance is tough. Can have some busy weeks due to the ""move fast"" culture. Plus you have a lot of ownership which brings with it some stress.

I've noticed the following:

1) The company embodies ""move fast"". If you can prove you can create a vision and build momentum for a product and a team, you will be given the reins to move as fast as you can at FB. I've taken a project from 0 to 1 to launch in 4 countries in 4 months.

2) The company embodies ""be bold"". There are no ""small swings"" around here. There might be a lot of incremental work, optimization and tweaking on all fronts but when the company realizes progress needs to be done in an area, it's no holds barred. The big bet I'm currently leading has lead to 2 teams merging and org structures adapting to enable that shift.

3) The company embodies ""be open"" - There is a transparency to the decision making, be it at team level or at management and leadership level I've never encountered before. It's refreshing to be able to ask any question I want to Mark every Friday during the Q&A for instance.","One thing has underwhelmed me and that is that management isn't as available as I wish it would be.

Many employees do not have much perspective on the greater world. One senior engineer claimed that they were ""poor"", which I found ridiculous.

Company culture is so, so good. I've had two great managers who both have done an excellent job supporting my growth and guiding my career.

It also feels like senior and C-level management really cares about employees. It feels like Facebook the company really tries to support me as a whole person (but be sure to ask for what you need! nobody's a mind reader).

For eng, bootcamp and team selection are such a good idea. I freaking love my team, and I get to own my decision to join that team (rather than some hiring/allocation manager deciding where I get to go).

Very few operational rules/bureaucracy. I can ssh into any machine I need to. If someone's fighting a fire anywhere in the company and I am able to help, I feel like I can always jump in to help. I really like Infra, so being at a big company like FB is super fun.","Oncalls can kill your sleep during your oncall shift if things are noisy overnight

It goes without saying that this company takes GREAT care of its employees, and then some. The work is challenging and super intense, but the positive and collaborative cultre, along with all of the perks/benefits offered, make the intensity much easier to deal with as opposed to any other company I've worked for.

I've been at FB for a bit over four months, but I knew during my interviews (btw these were the hardest interviews I've ever had) that this was the place to be. From application to job offer, it took 6 weeks. When I got the offer, it was so strong that there as no need to negotiate. When I got the job and relocated from NY to CA, the relocation package was was so good I didn't have to raise a finger or spend a dime. Already knew at that point that this company knows how to retain talent.

This place truly rewards merit, courage, and being outspoken. Management is aware enough (at least in my space) to place me in a role that plays to my strengths, and I've enjoyed th freedom to make my role what I want to be. They are very outspoken when you're performing well and are honest about things that need improvement. If you have a good idea that is supported by data and aligns well with the goals of your team or whatever your target population may be, you will find resources or people to join you in your efforts. From hackathons to day-to-day work, this culture permeates every area of the company. 

One thing that strikes me the most is how strong the diverse community (however small) is within this company. There are a lot of resources put towards ERG/FBRG efforts, and as a diverse employee, this means A LOT to me. 

I know the norm is to move around the industry every five years or so, but I don't see myself leaving this company for a long time. In just four months, I feel deeply rooted here, and I intend be here for a while. If you're reading this, there should be no question about applying, interviewing, or accepting an offer. You'll be happy that you made the decision.","This may be limited to my team or my area of the company, but I believe there is an underlying ""me, me, me"" culture at FB. There is a constant need to make your work visible so that others know what you're doing and so that whoever has a similar idea doesn't take the shine before you do. 

Separately, everyone wants to do knock-out work, and at times are secretive about the things that they're working on so that they can have that ""holy crap"" moment when they finally finish and reveal the results of their work. This can result in wasted resources and time since multiple people/small groups coule be working on the same thing without knowing it. Not sure what the solution is, but this at times takes away from collaborative work. I identify it as a con, but I've quickly found myself doing the same thing, and that's just because it's an underlying, unspoken culture at the company.",More work needs to be done re: PSCs. There has recently been a statement made about how PSC should not only focus on short term work but also reward long-term work. I would like to see that implemented and encouraged at a granular level. Managers should be trained to encourage long-term projects and reward employees when ambitious checkpoints are hit.,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,"December 12, 2017",Global Director of Recruiting Programs,"Thanks for taking the time to provide feedback.

Having had a job at Facebook makes it pretty easy to at least get interviews anywhere else.

The perks and benefits are also fantastic, and the pay is great.","SO MANY.

Again, the glamor of working at Facebook was enough, for a while. And when the company and research team were smaller, it was a lot better.

But now, the research culture at Facebook is *TOXIC*. Management is full of people who are there because they want to further their careers, not because they want to help their team members grow. I had a string of awful managers, one of whom actively discouraged me from following my ambitions. (Note that not all managers are awful, some were amazing and I sought them out as mentors instead of my own managers.)

Being a researcher at Facebook - especially from 2015 on, was discouraging and miserable enough that it ruined my confidence in my own abilities. Researchers were competitive with each other, and instead of focusing on improving the product, focused on edging out their colleagues for opportunities and recognition.

I know several wonderful people who left the company because of the toxic atmosphere and poor management.","Listen to ICs when they say that management is making them miserable. 

Promote people because they truly embody the Facebook management ethos (management is a support role!), not because they think it will look good on their resumes. 

Don't be afraid to fire people who are bad at their jobs.

- The company is innovating and revenue growth is phenomenal. Which means the equity value grows significantly YoY. 

- Comp is good here. Facebook generally overpays a lot of recruiters compared to Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This could be attributed to desperation because of how difficult it's been to hire recruiters.","- The bar has significantly dropped in recruiting. Because of the hyper growth Facebook is going through they've been forced to hire inexperienced recruiters and also rejects who weren't able to hack it in other top tech companies & start-ups. It used to mean a lot to be a full time recruiter at Facebook. Now it feels like they're giving an offer to anyone with a pulse. Inexperienced recruiters or bad ones can attribute to poor candidate experience and headaches for other recruiters. 

- Performance Reviews many times aren't a true reflection of individual performance. It's a problem that many companies have and Facebook is one of them. 

- The company has become so corporate. It's like you're just another number and the impact you're making is insignificant.

2. Because FB is quite the name, it is easier to hire a new person than hire someone internally. Since every single employee here, there are tons of other talented people outside that can be hired. So turnover happens for those that burnout or are stagnating in their roles and cannot progress. If you are in a non-tech role, it can feel like you are ""replaceable"" because there are 100's if not 1000's of people waiting in line to get your role that does something that is not as advanced as coding or building production code. 
3. work/life balance as most say can take a toll on you, but this is up to you take control.

They have excellent on-boarding and training programs: for individual contributors, for managers, and at the executive levels. Senior leadership is very approachable. Its straightforward to find good mentors and collaborative partners. The ""social networking"" that goes on inside the company is richly informative and generally very positive.

Despite being a large company, it retains a youthful feel, with an appetite for risk and decisive action which is dazzling given the scale and the weighty consequences that entails. 

People are honest and direct, and ""company politics"" is discouraged by a robust culture that strives to keep alive the best of Facebook-- while also staying pragmatic and adaptable.

The company is earnest and generally unflinching in applying its principles. Especially, it moves fast and gets things done. Earnest and purposeful.

Human executed processes, around hiring and planning, are tight and well reasoned.","The company is so driven by short-term impact that it is relatively harder here to carve out large, long-term plans.

Work-life balance can be an issue.

Separation of professional life and personal life is less here than some might be comfortable with.

Internal tools and quality can be lacking -- but there is a rising commitment toward changing that.","Mark Zuckerberg and senior leadership have won great admiration and respect from the employees.

To be frank, I didn't have high expectations going in that it would be very different from the misogynistic cultures I've had to navigate at previous companies. 

Before working at Facebook, I'd kind of come to accept that being a female engineer would always be a somewhat isolating existence and the best I could do would be to find a team with 90% great colleagues and just try and avoid the creepy and rude ones as much as possible. I'd seen that as long as they performed well (or held some other utilitarian value for the company) they would always have a place in a company and their treatment of women would be an open secret and accepted.

Honestly, my first couple months at Facebook made me aware of how much effort I'd been spending navigating those types of situations.

It's incredible working with people who assume your competence rather than constantly having to battle to prove yourself.

It's amazing seeing constant efforts towards dissecting internalized biases and senior male employees openly discussing their efforts to catch themselves unconsciously interrupting people. It's laughable to try to imagine this happening at my previous companies.

I did not find any pro in the product support team. 

I would recommend working at Facebook, but be very aware of which teams you join, the core responsibilities, the manager, the career level your are joining at etc.","- It was a struggle to spend time in such a monotonous and mundane role. 
- I was sold this role to be a product role, but this is a pure Operations role. 
- Do not be fooled when asked / told about strong analytics required etc, you would most likely end up answer to angsty folks in sales teams and doing customer service.

Please spend your time in a core role, it is where you'd have value in Facebook. It is easy to feel rudderless in this role (no matter what is told to you during your interviews). Employees in non-support / core roles are valued in the company, unfortunately this team and its immediate umbrella organization is not one of them.",Please place focus on the Managers.

0,0,0,8 May 2017,00:09:28,Great Place to Work but, Business Operations,"Menlo Park, CA",Former Employee ,full-time, more than 3 years,4,"- At it's best working at Facebook is fast paced, fun and extremely impactful. I've been given opportunities to work with many great colleagues who care deeply about the work that you're doing and will challenge and encourage you to do better. 
- Support staff at Facebook is amazing whether it be the people who greet you in the morning, facilities, IT, the security guards, chefs, or the the people who work at the gym. Everyone is super friendly and has your best interest at heart. It's like going to work at a 5 Star Hotel every single day :)
- Feedback is taken very seriously and typically acted upon. For example a couple of years ago Facebook didn't offer 4 months paternity leave for employees outside of the US and after receiving feedback from international employees this was policy was expanded globally
- Perks are amazing, free food, gym (or membership for offices without gyms), laundry, great healthcare.","- Mid-level managers are a hit or miss. I've had 4 different managers in 3 years at Facebook and my experience at work has greatly been dependent on how competent they are. My best manager pushed me and opened doors and was a true advocate for me within the company, whereas my worst manager who was also a first time manager made me feel as if I was working on an island. If you're joining Facebook in a non-tech role you should definitely try your best to get a feel for your future manager.
- As the company has hired over 10K+ people over the past 3 years roles and responsibilities are definitely becoming more specialized and opportunities to drive tangible impact are becoming increasingly difficult for people in junior roles
- Pay and benefits for people working in international offices are not comparable to working at HQ. For example IVF is offered in the US but not non-US offices.","As Facebook grows and continues to invest in hiring, finding people with prior management experience will be key to retaining and developing talent.",4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,"June 28, 2017","Director, Global Recruiting Programs and Operations",We appreciate your honest feedback.

Many companies as competitive as this expect a lot from their employees, and so does Facebook.

I've had this dissonance in past roles: ever since academia years ago, I've been out of the ""research"" phase and into the ""engineer at a X company"" stage, where ""X"" is occasionally a software product but more often a service or commercial product. The culture was not one of making the right things, but making the profitable thing now. Driven by sales people, there was a lot of grandstanding, peacocking, both in the culture and in the message.

Facebook has my people, my culture. We do things in the way that scales and makes engineering sense. Sure, perfect is the enemy of good enough, but if a temporary shortcut remediates a problem or a need, it's quickly iterated to improve, all the while immersed in a tech culture: Pusheen, Archer, Dr Who, Starwars, memes, the micro-actions that continually reinforce a culture-fit or a culture-miss.

I'm in the culture fit. Sure, I get a very competitive salary, plus my tech chops improve (when C++ gurus review your work, your C++ quality improves), and the food, and the perks, but above all, this is the place I feel I most fit.

I'm in my mid-40s. I ""get schooled"" my mid-20s. ...and it's awesome.","Pace is a killer. The work is complex, as are the discussions about it, I have little fuel in my head to code after work.

- Amazing perks
- Good pay, great stock options
- Hiring process is very streamlined and makes you feel very welcome
- Bootcamp is the best training I've experienced in my 10-year career at any company
- You get to pick a team you join","- Your experience is a Russian roulette and 100% depends on your manager and your team.
- HR promise things that are a lie - for example, that they hire you for the company and you can switch teams if you're unhappy, but if someone influential on your team wants to destroy you, they will (and with HR's blessings, HR will show you the door instead of being the helping hand, because they have a line up of 500 new hires next week, so who cares)
- Non-existent work life balance (which I don't mind as long as I'm able to actually do my job efficiently and not spend countless hours on useless, counterintuitive corporate processes, meetings and politics - that's the frustrating part - long hours and not getting much done)
- Immature, clueless, helpless management - manager will provide no help in a toxic situation, approve of back stabbing, won't listen to your concerns, will play politics and favorites - and since the review process 100% depends on your manager's mood, you're in for a rollercoaster ride.
- Micromanaging, lack of autonomy - they tell you they hire you for your talent and experience (after all, you're one of the lucky 5-10% top candidates who actually get through the series of 5-7 interviews), only to treat you like a 3-year old who cannot be trusted to make even the most trivial decision by themselves. And of course with your hands tied, you can't perform well and ""be bold"" (like on the wall posters across the office) or make ""impact"", when every line of code you write must be first approved (and blocked!) by someone from the clique who wants to climb the ladder on your back, so a power struggle begins (and you're going to lose because you ""don't belong""). Officially you're evaluated solely on some expectations, but unofficial stack ranking performance system (you're compared to peers) means peers are passive aggressive and compete against you instead of collaborating with you, and of course will play politics and back-stab you.
- Your experience, skill, talent and knowledge don't matter if you're new to the club. Someone senior in the team (but junior in terms of total industry experience), who is your manager's favorite boy, will get better projects, more impact, more decision making and the power to destroy you if you dare to hurt their fragile ego (by daring to give them useful technical feedback and suggesting ideas that may actually solve the problem better). If you're not happy with the leftovers you get or actually want to make some impact, participate in decision making, improve some inefficient processes (so you and the whole team can benefit and perform better) and solve some problems, you are made feel very unwelcome and shown the door.","Just hire competent managers who know how to deal with passive-aggressive toxic workers, with conflict, who know how to foster collaboration instead of competition, who are objective and actually sometimes listen to feedback instead of just talking their employees down all the time.

Everything just *works*, and it's mostly consistent throughout the entire company. Everyone uses the same code review process. Everyone uses the same build tools. Everyone uses the same check in process (per repository). Everyone uses the same employee feedback process. etc... There are also lots of internal services that are really helpful. Services for deployment, managing configuration, a/b testing, etc. Because everyone uses the same tools, everyone invests in them and they're well-documented, easy to learn, etc.
- People: everyone I've worked with is really smart and happy to lend a helping hand. Haven't had any issues so far.
- Work: I've enjoyed the kind of problems that I get to solve at Facebook much more than the kind of problems I got to solve at Microsoft. I worked on four different teams at Microsoft. The problems here are more challenging and require scalable, efficient solutions.
- Culture: The culture here is fantastic. Internally, there is a lot of transparency. There isn't too much politics. You can make improvements on part of the codebase. There isn't much process to slow you down. There is a lot of individual freedom in what your prioritize and work on.
- Work life balance: I've had great work life balance here. I typically work 35-40 hours a week, and I've not once stayed late for dinner. On-call is pretty light--much easier than on-call at Microsoft. This might vary by team.
- Food: Really good food. Lots of healthy options (and unhealthy options if you want a cheat day).

0,0,0,5 October 2016,02:27:39,Great place to work; Hard to navigate career growth and internal politics, Analyst,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,full-time, more than a year,45,"- Amazing benefits. They really take care of employees. 
- Great workplace environment. Coworkers feel like family and are very supportive of each other. 
- Mission of the company truly runs deep. 
- Flexible work hours and environment. There is generally a high degree of trust between employees.","- The open floor plan can be completely draining (especially for introverts, like myself). 
- Very unclear career growth. I started as an early career employee and one of the main reasons I left was because I felt like there was really little investment in my professional and personal growth. I found that Facebook really likes employees that will work hard and make them look good, but they don't care about helping you move up to the next level. There was no clear progression. A part of this is the flat organizational structure, which appeals to some but not to all. 
- Very millennial feeling (I'm a millennial too) and can feel extremely unprofessional at times. No line between personal and professional relationships. Again, this is up to personal choice but it didn't feel great to me all the time. 
- Cult-like worship of upper management (Mark and Sheryl). They are awesome people to look up to but people are not critical enough of the company all the time. It felt like people were always blind-sided by the flashiness of M-team's messaging. 
- Facebook hires a lot of contractors to full-time positions (especially in Austin), which can feel irksome. 
- Since the company has grown so much, they need to stop acting like a startup. 
- It's easy to do work that isn't actually fulfilling but is necessary to run the company. 
- Loved the mission and messaging of the company but didn't feel like my work was impactful in any way, which was an unfortunate feeling. 
- Pay is not that good for entry level/early career business side roles. Engineers make a lot more, unsurprisingly. 
- This is an engineer-run company, after all. So if you are on the business side, expect to be heavily reliant on engineering resources, which can be extremely draining and frustrating. 
- Facebook says it's easy to transition between roles and teams but I found that to not be true. That's another reason why I left. It may be easier on the engineering side. Additionally, being a remote office truly limits your networking and career opportunities (even if they tell you otherwise). 
- I had more managers than I could count in one year. The turnover was way too high and I didn't feel like anyone was invested in me. I wasn't growing and as an early career professional, growth is my top priority.
- Facebook is a global company and most of its users are outside of the US. However, the mindset is still extremely American and I frankly found the way in which people talked about users outside of the US to be downright offensive at times. There was no desire to get to deeply understand user behavior and market trends outside of the US. Given how the world economy is trending, Facebook will be in a bad position if employee mindsets don't change. There are companies all over the world (especially in Asia) that are taking over (and have already taken over) the spaces Facebook is trying to break into as of late.

Beautiful campus","Not every team is created equal at Facebook. I'm a Product Support Specialist at Facebook working under the Global Shared Services department. Unfortunately, the role that was stated in the JD is not the role that I am in. 

I was told the Product Support role would be a precursor to Product Management and that you will be spending a lot of time strategizing and helping product teams with their product roadmaps. A couple weeks in, and I soon realized that this role is purely operational and SLA based. We manned bug reports on a daily basis. Everything was numbers driven, but not in the right way. We were encouraged to analyze the tickets to find ways to improve SLA. 

Leadership is quite weak. They only listen to our goals and aspirations but neither help us or nor point us to the right direction. Most of the team don't plan to stay for long. Everyone seems to have a plan B or to be using this role as a springboard to another one within Facebook.

Although I hear great things from other teams, this one is not it.","When hiring for new recruits, don't sell them on what the team will be in 2 years. Let them know what is the current state of the team. Be honest about how much time is spent on day-to-day ""tasks""

Try to be a leader and not numbers driven for your own career benefits.

Facebook is an open company, uphold those cultures.",2.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Approves of CEO,"February 7, 2017",Your Friends at Facebook,"Thank you for your feedback.

0,0,0,30 November 2016,09:15:01,"Facebook is the worst job, except for all the others", Infrastructure Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",Former Employee ,full-time, more than 3 years,13,"Facebook is probably the best big company to work for. The company cares a lot about having its employees being productive and satisfied with their jobs and it works hard at maintaining an environment to support that. As a survivor from the real world, this is really rare -- pretty much every company-wide system is designed to make life easier for employees. The benefits and conveniences offered are amazing.

Many decisions about the company and its goals are made fairly transparently and open discussion about most things is encouraged. This can get really annoying at times.

Unlike most companies, Zuck is actually a pretty inspiring leader. He makes mistakes, but does learn from them. He has really lofty goals, though, and doing the right thing is highly subjective when trying to change the world.

If you are politically savvy and willing to work hard and make sure others notice that hard work, you will go far. You will learn a lot if you seek out opportunities to learn, and work with a lot of very talented people. You have to own this yourself, though; don't count on a lot of support.","Facebook still believes that it is a magical meritocracy reasonably free from corporate nonsense. While there aren't any Office Space-style TPS reports to fill out and you don't have to bring in your own coffee and toilet paper, it is now just a big company job like any other. If you want something, whether it be a promotion or a good dessert from the cafeteria, you have to plan how to get it, execute on the plan, and then make sure everyone else knows what you did and how great it was. You also have to share just enough detail to be convincing but not so much that people can poke holes in your story or usurp your dessert acquisition techniques.

The typical first level line manager at Facebook doesn't have prior management experience, only knows the Facebook way of doing things, and is overwhelmed with all the pressure being placed on them. It's a really hard job, too; your manager will be responsible both for setting the direction of your team and for making sure you and your colleagues grow at the company. Most people are not good at either of those things, let alone both. Be aware of what your manager is looking for and how to best communicate it.

Everything FB does is subject to a lot of public scrutiny, and you will know how the sausage is made and see that the goals of the company aren't focused on invading privacy or global domination like everyone else thinks. It's hard to see this thing that takes up so much of your life lionized and loathed by the press and your friends.

For engineers, a lot of the tools you will use day-to-day are incomplete, broken, poorly documented, and might not be supported anymore. You will get used to this. ""Move fast and break things"" is more complicated than it sounds, and that's really hard to adapt to when coming from a more traditional company. Have big goals but chop them up into small tasks with well-defined success indicators and communicate them early and often.","To the director- and VP-level people that have been at FB a long time: it's not the same company you went to work at lo those many years ago. There are between 5 and 50 times more employees now, way more products, and way more moving parts. If you want Facebook to stay Facebook-y, invest in the culture that you love. Teach people how to be successful and reward individuals that focus on impact that makes everyone's work easier and the product better, not on whatever new hotness made a contrived graph go in the right direction. Lots of things aren't working right anymore and it is up to you to start the hard conversations about which sacred cows can't provide enough milk for tens of thousands of employees because you never taught the new people how to talk about that stuff.",3.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,3.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Approves of CEO,"December 15, 2016",Your Friends at Facebook,"Thanks for your feedback.

0,0,0,1 May 2015,00:56:22,Landslide win over Google for career growth, Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,full-time, less than a year,165,"I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.
3. Despite good acquisitions for solidify the position in social media, social networks, there is still uncertainty about the future of this company.",,5.0,2.0,5.0,,5.0,4.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,"July 10, 2015",Your Friends at Facebook,"We're happy to hear that you are thriving at Facebook and have been making an impact from day 1.

- Play to your strengths. Too many companies and too many people work on improving weaknesses, in hopes of becoming well-rounded. This is fine, but often the better strategy is to play to your strengths, where employees do more of what they're good at, and less of what they're not good at, in a diverse team. I've never seen this done as well as at Facebook.

- Moving fast at scale. There are so many tools and frameworks to help you still move fast, as fast as any startup, that's it awesome. So impressive at Facebook's scale.

- World-class team. I know this is said often and loses meaning, but it's true here. Every single person is both smart and nice, a rare combination.

- They care about the right things, and don't care about the wrong things. Both parts of this are important. Too many companies sweat the small stuff that doesn't matter, e.g. who's invited to a meeting or whatever. At Facebook, everyone is just trying to make a positive impact, without care for politics etc.","- Things change fast. If you're not at ease with change, or if you're seeking a place that never changes, this is not the right company for you. This includes projects, tools, technologies, teams...

- There are multiple technical ways of doing most things. It's not always clear which is the best way, so you have to ask people. I think that's actually OK as you get to know your colleagues. But if you're the kind of person who wants perfect documentation for everything, this is not the place for you.","Stick to what you're doing, it's working :)",5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,"December 15, 2016",Your Friends at Facebook,You've highlighted some of the key things that make our culture unique.

0,0,0,28 September 2016,14:23:16,data engineer,,,,,,7,"The only pros I can think of is not really job related. The Disney like setting is good to bring your kids and family to if they are visiting. But the novelty wears of after 2-3 visits. The summer picnic parties used to be fun before but now it is too crowded and held at cheap locations - like this year it was at one of the piers in SF. 
As a data engineer you can try to understand the topology of the data systems and see how they work. You can look at the code base and see how they all fit together. See how the log streaming works and how it makes its way into the data storage. These are not job related activities but it will help you in your interview at your next job.","There are several. Note that the role specific ones are only for data engineers. What I have found is that there is a lot of difference in the way different groups function, so if you join as a SWE or as a product manager, your experience may be different.

1. The work environment is very open and very noisy. There is absolutely no privacy. This becomes more of a bother here because there are so many people now in all of their buildings. The only time when I was able to do any serious work was when I was working from home.
2. As a data engineer, you will be working with a very old version of Hive (0.10 I think). This is the version even before the one with windowing clauses. I was used to working with a better version that also had CBO and I found this limiting. Not only that, if you do this for a year or two you will be at a disadvantage when you switch jobs.
3. The data engineers are at the lowest rung of the pecking order. Some call them 2nd tier engineers. I call them data peons. They do not get any say in the kind of work they get to do. Any grunt work can be passed on to you and because of the way the review system works, they can screw you if you show any displeasure. An example of this is the data visualizations. The data engineer is expected to do that. I never had to do that before. So you will be spending a lot of time doing housekeeping work like making sure the pipelines run, making sure the font and color choices you made on the dashboards are pleasing to the analysts who sit on top of you in the pecking order. And to add insult to injury, the visualization tool is a home grown one and none of the skills you get from using it are going to help you in a future job i.e. if you plan to continue doing visualizations.
4. Data peons are treated differently as compared to software engineers. Whereas on occasion the software engineers get to work exclusively on different projects for up to a month, there is no such options for data peons. So mobility is very very limited.
5. The performance review system is stacked against data peons. Because they are at the lowest rung, most of the people reviewing them are analysts or above. So the analysts are the overlords even when some of them are absolute idiots. The only ones who can survive in this system are ones with a servile attitude and with mediocre talent and ambition.

Some of these are because of recent org changes. A lot of the people I know who joined around the same time as me have left the company.","Even though Mark is one of the most open and humble CEOs I have even worked for, there is a lot of abuse and harassment happening in the lower levels of the Org chart.

Later when I was integrating I had to rework everything from level 0. project manager, Manager, Team Lead, UI Expert were all supervising my work. When ever they pass by my desk, they would ask me to make few changes may it be to the Layouts, data to be displayed etc. the worst part is that their opinions do not match at all. 
for instance .. Project Manager would stop by my desk and asks me to change the layout and I obey and customize the layout to include that change. Later team lead would stop by and says ""This is disgusting Layout. better change it. when I change it taking his suggestions. Manager would stop by and says its the worst that he has ever seen in his life and asks me to include his recommendations. Later UI expert comes and commands me not to follow instructions of any others and to just follow his recommendations as he is the UI expert. When I do that Others (Project Manager, Manager etc) hate the changes and I was evaluated low in performance.

They incentivize positive behaviors and spend money on things that actually improve employee health, happiness, and job satisfaction. Their goals are clear and they are consistent in applying policy while allowing reasonable room for variation. 

Leadership strongly emphasizes avoiding bias, treating everyone equally, and creating a positive environment, and that has a very clear positive impact at every level. As a woman in tech this is by far the most welcoming/comfortable place I've worked.","Like any software company with a lot of recent college grads (and especially one that places a high value on transparency), there can sometimes be a bit too much handwringing about culture and values and long, circular discussions on whether something does or doesn't fit the culture/values. But it comes from a good place, and again the company leadership do actually support those values and incentivize following them. 

Also, because 'working hard, contributing useful work and accomplishing things' are heavily incentivized, good people tend to be very busy. For a big tech company work-life balance is pretty good, but it is easy to load up your plate with way too much to do, or it's sometimes hard to get time with your manager because they've done that.",A bit more emphasis on a) time management and b) assuming positive intent would be great.

0,0,0,15 February 2016,10:39:24,Continuous Improvement, Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,full-time, more than 5 years,12,"I've been at Facebook for more than six years. The culture is very introspective and dedicated to self-improvement; if it were the same company it had been in 2009, I wouldn't still be there. Everytime I think I might leave, a new awesome project comes up that keeps me around. Seeing Mark Zuckerberg mature into the great leader he is has been magical, and I have a lot of trust in Sheryl and Mark and Mike Schroepfer to make good decisions. 
In many ways, engineers are more productive now than they were in 2009, despite the fact that we work at a big company now. We have more tools, resources, and knowledgeable people at our disposal, which compensates to some degree for the increased bureaucracy you see in some parts of the company. We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value. Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives. That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies.
Especially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up. You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas. The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so; management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies.
When joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of ""bootcamp"" which means you'll have an informed choice. It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process.
One of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work. Another is a recognition that you can advance your career without going into management, and that there are many different kinds of talent. There are several different ""archetypes"" of senior individual contributors that are recognized and encouraged to flourish.","Facebook has become more careful in certain core areas like Newsfeed, Timeline, Ads, and Platform. There are many stakeholders on these products and thus you've got to get a lot more things buttoned up before you can launch a product change in these core areas. We still do experiments but not quite as freely as before. Just understand that the more impact your product has, the tougher it will be to make changes, and place yourself in the company according to your preferences.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,,"March 31, 2016",Your Friends at Facebook,"Thank you for sharing your experience.

You get to work with a visionary leadership team that is incredibly accessible and wants to hear from you. Mark's Townhall meetings grew out of the weekly Q&A that he runs internally. If you want to ask Mark Zuckerburg or Sheryl Sandberg a question you can do it. If you want to give feedback or see changes in nearly any aspect of Facebook you will be empowered to do it.

Your team will likely be comprised of industry experts in your particular area of work. From kernel hackers, PhD's in computer learning, hardware engineers building drones and our own servers, to network engineers that are helping write drafts and RFC's that define the underlying protocol architecture of the Internet - you will find everything under the sun and these people will make you so much better at what you do.

If you aren't enjoying what you're doing in your current role you can go on a Hack-a-month with another team. This lets you expand your skills working on a different set of challenges and stay on your new team when you finish, if you like the work, or head back to your old team to work on something else. The best part is that management encourages these types of moves!

The management teams empower you to work on the things you want to, and gives you the ability to impact billions of people. You work on one of the biggest platforms on the planet and you will see the results of the work you put in everyday in making it better.

Also, the benefits are pretty amazing.","Any complaints seem like extreme first world gripes given all that the company does to keep the employees happy and progressing in their positions and careers, but I do have a few.

The company will absolutely (and gladly) take as much time as you put in. They don't overly pressure you to work insane hours, but you will be surrounded by overachievers who put that pressure on themselves and create the perception that large swaths of the company are, ""always working."" This can be a blessing or curse and it is up to each individual employee to figure out the dreaded work / life balance equation for themselves.

The other issue, is that Facebook prides itself on not competing on salary, RSU's, etc. against offers from other companies. While that may seem ok in practice, it results in a revolving door (which is a bit of a Silicon Valley issue in and of itself) between other big tech companies and Facebook. We won't make counteroffers to keep people, but we'll pay them what they wanted before they left to come back which sets a bad precedent for the people who stay.",Keep doing what you are doing.,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,"February 26, 2016",Your Friends at Facebook,Thank you for sharing your feedback.

How am I here? How does this company exist?"" Facebook is the epitome of the perfect company. A wise man once told me about the four Ps of the perfect employment: Product, Problem, People, Profit. 

Is the Product interesting? This product serves over 1.5 billion people - it is the most exciting product to be part of.

Is the Problem interesting? Beyond interesting. We're trying to solve making the entire world more open and connected through communication, through sharing, through education, etc... In any area of the company, the problems are all great problems to solve.

What about the People? The people are literally the best people I've ever worked with in any position I've been through. They are brilliant, kind, friendly and completely supportive. I left my last company as a senior member and at Facebook, I still feel like I'm learning something new from my colleagues every single day. Beyond my colleagues, the leadership here are more than supportive about an individual's career growth to help us grow deep within our roles, support groups to help you become a better manager, classes to help individuals transition from one career to another. I've seen many of my colleagues get the opportunity to completely change paths (e.g. Designer to Engineer, Researcher to Designer, Designer to PM, etc). You pave your own path and leadership here is supportive to help you get to where you want to be.

So what about Profit? Facebook, luckily, is doing very well in this area. At a personal level, Facebook pays also very well. I was lucky enough to have my total acquisition package matched and exceeded which made saying yes to Facebook a no brainer.

Take a great product, great people, amazing culture and a beautiful place to work and tie that all up in a bow. That is what Facebook is and I hope it never changes. I love this place!","The only con I've found is that Facebook's campus is a bit in the middle of no where but honestly with the flexible shuttle system and an all-day shuttle that goes back and forth between downtown Palo Alto, it's not so bad.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,"December 17, 2015",Your Friends at Facebook,We couldn't agree more. :) Facebook is truly a special place with a unique combination of people who are the best at what they do working together as one team to connect the world.

- Facebook holds one of the best standards on its benefits - better than all companies with equivalent size.
- People working here are just happier than average industry level, due to this reason you would feel happier too.
- Company momentum is just great, so this could be potentially a place you can stay for a while.
- Great engineers just come from all other companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. College new hires come from top ones: Stanford/MIT/CIT and things.
- Good amount of people here are both smart and diligent, you have many to learn from.
- Although coworkers are competitive here, they are much nicer to work with than other companies holding same 'elite principals'. For example, I rarely see (though there're few) arrogant people here. The whole culture was built in the sense to favor people who are both smart and humble.
- Culture encourages transparency, so you have to learn hear and accept sometimes very tough feedbacks, but you could end up growing much faster as you can tell.
- If you are good, there's no barrier on 'what you can do'. Facebook does NOT reveal your level to anyone else except your report. So you could see E3 engineers work like E4 or even E5 in the end. But in another way around, it could be tough for seniors.
- Facebook sees deliveries (executions) as 1st priority, so people here just focus on work more than the rest, I believe this is one of the biggest reasons why this company moves faster than other companies with equivalent size.
- Most of work in Facebook reaches great amount of people (1.5B in web, 1.3B in mobile), and great amount of revenue (20B of this year). So you can tell how much impact you can have, and this would to the minimum becomes a highlighting bullet point on your resume.
- People says Facebook has bad work/life balance, I don't agree: 1) you have freedom to pick a laid-back team and free to go almost anytime (they have hackamonth program and it is true), 2) most of time I see hardworking people working hard due to their own choice.","- People says Facebook has less politics, but I do feel some. Usually come from a group of people joining to same team from same company around same time.
- Culture encourages transparency, so if you're a smooth talker and avoid giving harsh feedbacks, this could become your problem in review.","In general Facebook sees culture as 1st priority in operations, I agree on this.

- Low tolerance of BS, low tolerance of ""everything is amazing, everyone is perfect"" when things can be improved. 
- The org moves fast with people issues, low performance (when appropriate), and childish behavior (very very low tolerance for this). 
- Incredibly lean orgs, especially in HR, so you really have the ability to own a business from end to end. 
- Low tolerance for politics or front stage/back stage behavior.

- there seems to be a group of the before and afters- who struggle to understand the company has grown and will not go back to the first 100 employees! This leads to a sense of entitlement and not playing as a team.
- commute. UGH
-Need to do better with giving back (as a company and as employees). I know our CEO has donated gazillions- but we need programs that allow employees to donate and have funds matched, and allow employees to volunteer their time.

0,0,1,5 October 2015,15:20:58,Perks Beyond Comprehension and an Opportunity to Change the World,,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,full-time, more than a year,4,"If the reviews here sound like employees are really drinking the Kool-Aid...it's because many of them are. The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do. 

-Unbelievable benefits and compensation. Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing. Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a ""baby bonus""), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on. 
- Strong company culture and values. I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely. Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, ""Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?"". Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident; there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the ""#shiplove"" mantra is strong here.
-Work/life balance. You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here. I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends.
-Facilities. It's Facebook! The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors. Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk.
-Efficient and fast. Fewer politics than many other companies of this size. A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system.
-The future! These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff. Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool.
-Women's leadership. I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams). They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a ""Managing Bias"" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering. They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most.","-Entitlement. After you've worked here for a while, it's easy to get entitled. I'd say 95% of employees keep their feet on the ground and appreciative and gracious about the benefits they receive, but the entitlement plus the company's culture of open feedback (""feedback is a gift"") occasionally breeds inane complaints in internal communication groups.
-That commute. If you live in SF, you'll have to hike down to Menlo Park, and depending upon where you're coming from and how bad traffic is that day, it could be as bad as 2 hours each day. The good news: that's rare, and company-provided transportation options (shuttles with WiFi) make this as easy as possible. You do get used to it, and your time on the shuttle is your own. Sure, you can do work, but you can also nap, watch Netflix, or read.","As you grow, you'll be tempted to cut back spending on benefits-- don't.

They indicated that no contractors could ever offer value; contractors were viewed as an extra pair of hands. However, my role was specifically to provide expertise and coaching in my domain area. The junior/mid-level staff never solicited feedback and assumed only their ideas were useful. Just because people say they are open to feedback does not make it so. I got unsolicited feedback constantly at FB: everyone has an opinion and thinks it's valuable. But, not once did anyone ever ask for my feedback. In that sense, and many others, it's a hypocritical environment. 

If you're junior or less than 15 years in your job, FB is probably a good place to grow. If you're more experienced, be sure you carefully evaluate the job. My experience is that I wasn't working with the best or brightest, more often they were the narrow-minded, arrogant and entitled.

Finally, in the area I worked, it was all about blame and pointing fingers when things went wrong.

They hire entry-level people, people with criminal records, on up to people that have an education and work ethic. (Most of us that worked at real jobs prior to this were laid off from a variety of professions.) You have to start as an entry level telemarketer pitching the help of ""Facebook marketing experts"". You can move up in the company, but you will only ever make $13.50 an hour +commission based on a bucket system. You cannot pay your bills on the sketchy way the sales are calculated. Some people run scams and do shady things to get ahead and get top commission. Bottom line is that it is a call center and you will never be treated like a real Facebook employee. Cheryl Sandberg recently spoke about all FB employees making MUCH more than the Revana employees. I guess Facebook's call center doesn't need to Lean In. We would have people from HQ (with the same job title but making in the $70k range) sit with us to learn how we do our jobs.

Most companies have a mission; some say they follow it, and extremely few are actually mission led. Facebook truly believes in making the world more open and connected; including those people who aren't even online yet. Every role and department ladders back to that. 

In advertising sales, we have the goal of building our client's businesses by connecting them to the consumers who matter to them. More importantly, we ensure that people on Facebook are seeing ads that are relevant and high quality, this delivers shared value both for the advertiser and the end person using our products. We also have proven and measurable results across verticals, which drives continued client interest and adoption. 

Having come from another founder led company, Mark is incredibly brilliant, open, honest and hard working. He surrounds himself with fantastic people, listens carefully, cares about the people who work for him, and makes long view decisions for the health of the company. 

Management and the people who work at Facebook follow leadership's example, everyone rolls up their sleeves to get the work done, and is incredibly grateful to be here. 

As a woman it's also inspiring and impactful to have female leadership at all levels, and colleagues who are incredibly encouraging. I personally experienced this when a male peer encouraged me to apply for a management position on our team. He referenced the known bias that women are less likely to apply if they don't have 100% of qualifications vs. men who take it as a suggestion. Beyond gender, the entire company strives for diversity and acceptance.","You have to be very self driven to succeed. Seeking out and maintaining internal relationships is critical for success.

Projects: Every team is understaffed, so there is a ton of incredibly important work to do everywhere. Because of this, you can work on high-impact (and potentially high-visibilty) projects from Day 1.

Autonomy: I've always felt extremely trusted in both my technical competency and prioritization skills. Management is (generally) helpful when I want help, but mostly I've been able to do my own thing and work on whatever project feels most important to the company and/or interesting to me.

People: Everyone is really smart, and most people are really friendly, funny, and generally awesome to hang out with.

Food: Amazing. Healthy options are phenomenal, as are the unhealthy ones.

Gym: The staff is incredible.

So much more!","- Stress: The company likes to run slim. As mentioned in the pros above, this means you're always working on impactful projects, but it also means your team is understaffed and you may have to work some nights and weekends to get stuff done (though definitely not as bad as the previous strartup I worked for). The more teams you work with, the worse this can get, since some people love to load up on meetings during the day.

Egos: There are some people who are really full of themselves and difficult to work with. This happens anywhere I've been, but there's a special brand of self-importance among some folks here. Fortunately, I've never had to work too closely with these people, but they make their presence known.","Zuck: Keep doing what you're doing. You articulate a great vision for the company and always seem very ""real"" at Q&As.

Lower management: Live true to the company goals. Unblock your reports, play to their strengths, and help them grow. Instead of requesting ""more leadership"" from ICs, say what that means and provide coaching.",5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Amazing food.,"Some huge, out-of-control egos in management, especially at the middle layers. Couple that with the general immaturity of the company and you'll see some very poor judgement and ""Game of Thrones"" style politics in a few departments. 

Average tenure of a staff engineer is about 4 years - mostly because after the initial stock grants vest there is near zero incentive for anyone under a Director level to stay any longer.

Culture creates and fosters entitled whiners - so much so that it is a running joke inside the company, with groups such as ""Patently Absurd Requests for Facebook Offices"" making fun of it all. But then again, this company is largely made up of the ""participation trophy"" generation, who have been told they were super-special since they were born. Being hired by Facebook amplifies that self-esteem level well beyond eleven. 

It is never spoken about, but staff turnover is huge. The washout rate of n00bs is likely around 40%. Truly talented staff move around, so team continuity is rare. 

Zero work-life balance - unless you happen to have a kid while working there.","Fix the broken review and calibration cycle, especially the schedule and unspoken stack ranking. Strive for higher competence levels in departments outside of Engineering - starting with HR.

The work-life-balance issue goes beyond the mere hours: it is expected that you become FB friends with all your coworkers, managers, etc. FB makes it impossible for the realm of your private life to remain separate from your workplace and coworkers.

The pace is amazing and you always feel like you are doing something important. 

Great people on my team. Really close knit and people I will have in my life for along time 

Free food!!! Cannot stress enough how much I love this. This saved seriously my life. Three meals a day and snacks.","I worked as a ""contractor"". My direct supervisor was wonderful and took the time daily to ask me about my day and was always concerned. However the upper management on the team was deceitful, uncaring, unkind and unapproachable. The last several months we have been told we would be getting a better role and that we would be able to have real careers, instead we are just getting another contract agency and losing what little access we have to the Facebook culture. 

Expensive parking. It costs us $200 a month to park or we can run the risk of parking on the street and getting tickets. 

People we work for/with that are Facebook ""fte"" do not know who we are. Some are great but several do not even try. 

Bad contract company. They are definitely not ""pros"". Paychecks were often wrong or late. Almost the entire time I have been here we did not have a company person in the office. When we did get one it drastically changed how we could interact with our supervisor. We could no longer go to him with issues but instead were asked to go to someone else who yet again doesn't know my name. 

No chance at advancements. While I have the same degree as my close friend that helped me get in the door as a contract employee I have no chance at becoming a true Facebook employee. Unless you are recruited for a job you will stand no chance at getting the job. I was told that when they hire contractors they look for friends but when they hire ""fte"" they look for pedigrees. If a recruiter didn't find you you stand no chance.","Be honest. In one year I have met the ""management "" three times. All three times have resulted in what I felt was dishonesty. She would talk to us like she had something else or somewhere else to be. 

It was made clear in the beginning that there would be no full time role. What was not made clear was how little concern management would have. Outside of my supervisor and a few people that we got to work with we had no contact with anyone else. 

Learn our names. You don't have to stop and chat with me everyday but don't look at me like I am a complete stranger when I say good morning. Politeness and people skills go a long way. Beer pong is cool. You know what is cooler? Knowing who I am when I talk you.",2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interesting story to tell your friends.,"If you're a manager, this place will drive you nuts. Employees are snarky, entitled, and disrespectful brats. They have no concept of critical thinking or any desire to do real work. 

Unlimited sick days in the hands of overpaid children is impossible to manage, my team would somehow always manage to catch a ""cold"" on Fridays and Mondays. (Interesting that they would Tweet and post about their weekend party binges though.)

While Facebook does a great job recruiting Ivy League talent, I was underwhelmed by the level of intelligence of ""Facebookers."" They are so busy congratulating themselves on being ""awesome"" that they never stop to consider they didn't have any real world work experience to back that assertion up. It's really hard to manage and lead people who ""know it all.""

Kitchy inspirational posters everywhere you look. ""Be Bold!"" ""Dare Greatly!"" Yet, I didn't see any substantive work or product coming out of anyone, which makes sense since Facebook really is just a glorified website - users are the product.

Communication is an absolute nightmare. You are forced to ""friend"" everyone you work with and join an incessant amount of internal group pages where you had to filter through all the BS people would post (memes, YouTube videos, snarky hipster comments…clearly these people didn't have enough work to do) to get to any relevant work related information you needed to know for your job. I actually thought I was going to get dumber working there.

Meetings - the sheer volume was mind bending. None of them critical to doing actual work, more self congratulating on unearned awesomeness. Being social at Facebook was far more important than doing anything meaningful while you were there. 

Anyone serious about doing meaningful work need not apply. You'll make it a few months and then quit out of frustration.",Grow up!!! You're not in Zuck's dorm room anymore.,1.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

0,0,0,26 September 2014,11:58:46,Facebook set me up for success, Engineering Manager,"Menlo Park, CA",Former Employee ,full-time, more than 3 years,16,"Facebook is a top tech company like Google, LinkedIn, Apple and many others. All of these companies offer basically the same thing: great engineers, good money, free food, impacting zillions of people and interesting tech problems. Facebook has a few things that set it apart:

1. Open-ness. Root on every box, access to every source repo. I very rarely had to wait to receive credentials to do anything. At other jobs you're often blocked sitting at your desk for a few days waiting for access to some repository.

2. Control over your career. You don't get hired into a specific team -- you choose it (in recent years they've added a list of teams you can choose from, but there's still a lot of variety). And if you get bored or feel stalled, you're encouraged to switch teams.

I don't think other companies offer those things. The real list of pros is huge, but since they could be applied to other companies I don't include them here.

The only reason I left is because I always wanted to start my own startup. Otherwise I would have stayed forever.","With everyone switching teams all the time there is often a lot of lost tribal knowledge. So there's parts of the codebase that no one understands anymore.

Since the Great Shift to Mobile there's been a focus on quality at the expense of moving fast. I really liked the Move Fast and Break Things mentality of Facebook when I joined, and though people disagree with me, I prefer it to the ""don't ship it until it's perfect"" mentality (I think many of the independent Facebook apps waited too long to launch).

Another thing that no one will agree with me on is the work-life balance. I have noticed a trend of people working less, hackathons running during the day, etc. I think your average employee is less driven and moves slower than a few years ago. This used to be a place where people were obsessed with shipping above all else. It isn't that anymore. This is a pro for some people but not for me. I'm giving it a 5 because I think it's good for your life, not because I agree with that balance.","I wish the PR team was more proactive rather than reactive. I understand how press cycles work, but Facebook does try to do the right thing and constantly gets skewered.

At every level of the company (at least on the technical side), the emphasis is overwhelmingly on supporting its brilliant engineers in delivering on tools that move to company forward in its deeply-felt goal of making the world more open and connected. There is an absolute minimum of bureaucratic crap. Compensation is generous and the perks are preposterous - well more than I want or need, really, but hey, if they're going to provide nearly free dry cleaning, I guess I'll use it.","Some of the mid-level management don't seem to know what they're doing - many/most of them are technical managers, and don't necessarily know how to organize, direct or motivate people. The biannual employee calibration cycle is absurdly excessive in scope, and literally absorbs managers' attention for 3-4 months out of the year. The internal organization is largely ad hoc and sorely missing in some of the fundamentals that would help the company scale more effectively - this is a consequence of the commitment to light structure.","Not every technical problem can be solved by a hackathon or its equivalent.

I think management is pretty good here as well, and you definitely work with really great engineers. The pay is great, the benefits are awesome, you are largely treated well, but this is a company you can definitely bite into too hard and overwork yourself. The place is still a lot more open internally than other corporate machines, less so since going public. Also, you get the sense that Mark has a vision, and really wants to execute on that.

-There are a lot of egos here. Definitely not representative of everyone, but some people slip through the cracks and it can be a drain working with them.
-The company is starting to feel really big. It's getting harder and harder to do anything very different as you have to convince more and more people that this is a good idea.
-If you're living in SF, then the location is pretty inconvenient. That and you'll just shove all your free FB swag in a drawer and never look at it again with all the tech protests lately.

Senior management are generally amazing people, smart, visionary and compassionate.","The focus on measuring means anything that can't be measured is ignored. It's easy to measure someone's ability to code on a whiteboard. As a result, the coders are much better than nearly everywhere I've worked, but that's it. Social skills and personality can't be measured. As a result there is no one here you would ever be friends. The internal surveys bear this point that people don't have friends at work. Similarly for managers, they are selected strictly for their technical ability. Again, they have zero compassion. In my time being here, I've never once felt like anyone cared if I was here or not. Not once has anything positive ever been said. It's really astounding.

Recruiting does an amazing job at making candidates feel wanted. That feeling disappears the moment you sign. After that, you have no manager or anyone who will care. You'll go into bootcamp where you'll have a ""mentor"". His role is to continue to do his job while counting the number of lines in your diffs to make sure you can make progress with no assistance.

After bootcamp, you'll have a manager who operates in the same mode. They are interested in the technology and not the people. To them, you are a resource to be maximized. They will tell you everything you need to do to improve, but never once say ""good job"". In boot camp, I kept meeting these amazing, visionary dynamic managers. I know realize they were the exception. Those people made me love Facebook during bootcamp, but that feeling wore off quickly once I interacted with the average line level manager.

Plus, beware of the reviews here. Recruiting will tell you point blank that they curate these reviews. The reason FB has the highest rating is because someone internally has a goal to achieve certain star ratings on this site.",Start selecting people for human relationship skills and focus less on pure technical ability.,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,5.0,4.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

There aren't a lot of rules, other than security/privacy practices. Even on mobile apps, your code ships fast. 

Facebook's onboarding process is the best I've ever seen, and I've worked at a lot of other major companies. You're hired as an engineer, not as someone to fill a specific job. Then you spend your first six weeks getting to know how all of the company works, filling in small holes on code bases that you aren't familiar with (web, Android, iOS, data analysis stuff), and learning what problems in the company you most want to work on, before you pick your team. Every large software company should be doing this.","They do claim ownership of code you write outside of work, unless you run it by legal first.","Don't ever get rid of Boot Camp.

Facebook is the only place where your work will affect over a billion people every day. That is ridiculous and awesome.

-Excellent benefits. Many people have elaborated on this below, and I will just confirm that it's great.

-Travel opportunities. With so many global offices, even the lowest-level employees often have a chance to travel for work. You get to meet a lot of really great people and see the world a bit this way.

-Strong professional network. Facebook still attracts many of the best and brightest, and it's a privilege to get to work with them. 

-Engaging and interesting work. I can't think of a single boring job at Facebook. The company is still tackling some of the most interesting and challenging problems in technology today.

-Great internal communication. Not many people talk about this, but Facebook runs almost entirely on Facebook groups, which is surprisingly efficient. Between that and their task-tracking solution (similar to Asana), internal communication is really good at scale.","-No longer a place for the inexperienced-but-motivated worker to learn on the job. The company is taking far fewer risks on new hires, preferring to bring people in from larger companies (e.g. Google) or more established backgrounds (e.g. business school, consulting firms). In aggregate, this means less creativity, more politics, and more fear of failure.

-Large contractor population. If you're coming in entry-level, you will most likely come in as a contractor rather than a full-time employee. Contractor hiring at Facebook is typically used as a way to get around headcount limits, not as a thoughtful or strategic approach to staffing, and you will probably feel that. There are limited opportunities for conversion (though it's still a great way to get your foot in the technology door).

-Poor investment in and accountability for managers. Many managers at Facebook were thrust into a management role because they were of an appropriate level - not because they are good managers. There is very little accountability for bad managers, and good management skills are rarely counted as notable. Early on, the company set a culture around managers not being different than anyone else - they just happened to manage. It's treated as a side project more than a full role, so there's no particular incentive to develop your people, nor are there any consequences if you're bad for your people.","Make managers accountable for unhappy, under-developed, or high-attrition teams. Set a universal philosophy around contractor hiring. And bring back 3pm margaritas - your employees need them!

Projects are run by PMs who really know what they are doing with a strong skill set in strategy, engineering, data driven decision making and user experience. 
Strategic direction - Money truly is a means by which we can achieve the mission to connect the world. There are tons of bold bets and we seem to have a good balance of reacting to the marketplace and maintaining focus on executing with blinders when necessary.
Opportunity - There is so much work for really anyone to come in and make. With such rapid growth, there are bound to be mega bugs or missed opportunities ripe for fresh eyes to come in and recognize immediately.
Culture - The company values are genuine and you really do get the feel that you are working on something bigger than yourself. Getting to hear from and ask questions of Mark each week really helps makes sure everyone is in the loop and feels heard if they disagree. You are never ""out of line"" for thinking big picture or questioning strategic direction and it is in fact encouraged. There's also a ton of young people so it is great to meet friends, especially if you live in SF.","Time - There are amazing perks like really quality free food all the time, a gym on campus with a basketball court and large playing field, shuttles to SF and surrounding areas but I often find my coworkers and I spend less time on that fun stuff that you might expect. There's just so much work opportunity because you are expected to be driving on projects rather than just doing what you are told so you could theoretically work all the time and its up to you to stop that.
Company maturity - Like all fast growing companies, there is a natural curiosity around ""how much better would things be for me if I had joined earlier?"" because there would have been ever more responsibility and financial potential. Both of those things are still really high but it does raise the natural question of it would make sense to gain the skill sets to understand what makes Facebook work and then consider working somewhere smaller with more financial upside.","I had high expectations for the company management and they have far exceeded them.

Genuinely nice and honest people can be found in every team.","From what I've seen in my time on multiple teams here, managers come in from different companies, take over teams, hire their own friends primarily from their previous companies, and then give the promotions to those people in a very short time. You may spend years hearing praise for the work you do, but it's never backed up with promotions. Also, this is not a good place to work if you are at all introverted, value family life more than work life, or prefer to work a normal person's schedule. If you are in a non-technical role, you also have little chance of seeing any kind of career advancement. Large divide in pay between people on the same teams and little transparency into the payment and growth processes. 

Additionally, most employees share a highly liberal political stance, which drives the culture in a mostly positive way, but it also requires that everyone agrees with the mindset. Those that have differing values can expect to feel ostracized. 

Finally, the treatment of vendors and contractors (including facilities staff, janitors, kitchen staff, security guards, and receptionists, among others) by employees can be staggeringly disappointing, embarrassing, and offensive.

- Culture of Instant glorification - There is a culture of moving fast, which is not well understood by all.

Also, very often, you see people trying to grab credit of something they had no contribution in, but are in a good position to take credit.

So, sometimes it's frustrating to see people benefiting just by pretending to contribute.","Try to balance the culture of instant glorification. This is leading to an environment where people are concerned only about short term projects because that's what reflects in their performance review.

*The benefits and perks are incredible - they really do make coming to ""work"" easy and not feel like work at all - we are spoiled
*The company culture is great you get to be ""who you are"" at work, its the most diverse group of people I've worked with and your colleagues become friends
*Huge addition to the resume - people who leave Facebook on good or bad terms go on to work for incredible companies or accomplish incredible things","If you are considering a role in the sales organization, I would truly consider your options and determine if it is the right fit for you. Do not join Facebook simply on the name, to add it to your resume, or to become wealthy - you will not find this company fulfilling especially in a sales role.

*Pay is not competitive (for sales) compared to other organizations with a similar footprint. You will likely take a pay cut coming to Facebook, and even with all the great benefits, you still need to pay a mortgage/rent, bills, and future savings. Similar to other organizations, there are two primary types of sellers (Account Managers & Account Executives) at Facebook these roles are basically the same with different titles and pay scales.
*As a seller, you are not properly incentivized to go above & beyond what is expected of you, in many cases if you exceed you're goal it actually hurts your compensation for the future due to the disproportionate weight your achievement is given for the future. I don't know a soul at the company who doesn't live and breathe what we do (consider this a pro or a con) but every quarter we are expected to work exponentially harder to deliver exponentially greater results while getting paid the same (or less if you are unable to deliver to the goal that was set)
*Management is unfortunately a disappointment - from the VP level down, the sales management team does not add much value. At the VP/Director level, a vast majority of people do not feel as though this person/people provide inspiration, guidance, or true leadership qualities. Through a recent reorganization, it seems lack of leadership and inspiration will only continue to be perpetuated. This is not meant to be a personal attack on any one specifically, but the irony of working at such a social and high profile company is that the Sales leadership are some of the most uninspiring and unimpressive individuals at the company.
*It feels extremely political. We have a well documented belief in openness, and cutting through red tape to do whats best for the organization. At the end of the day, the sales organization does not feel like like it is held to the same standard. People feel like they have to walk on eggshells about what kind of feedback they provide to their managers or management in general, favoritism from mid level managers to the director level runs rampant - know how to play the game. Often times decisions feel like they have been made based on what is good for a particular individual (what will make them look good to their own manager) versus what is best for the company and from this view point it appears that it pays off for those people who think of themselves before the company. This is not unique to Facebook, but its disappointing nonetheless given our values - the sales org truly feels like a ""say one thing, do another"" org when it comes to politics and openess in general.","To the C-Level Management: Reinforce the expectations of all managers to the team as a whole. Consider shifting responsibilities from certain managers, or highlighting what value your reports are driving for you. I've seen plenty of sales people leave, be fired, or managed out; I have not seen one mid level manager or upper level manager be fired or managed out - each sales person knows what the expectation is of themselves but I think there is overall confusion about the expectations our managers and directors are held to.
Continue moving to a solutions based approach to products & do not assume that the klout of Facebook will drive product adoption
Practice what is preached with openness and transparency in the organization

This is the best company a person could ever dream of working for, but working in the sales organization within this company is a test in patience - consider how you can make this org live up to the standards of the company.",3.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,2.0,1.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

My first day on the job I submitted a diff that now hundreds of millions of people see every day. Imagining a more connected world keeps me coming in every day, because I know that I'm building that future.

The Career Opportunities:
There is no arbitrary ladder, no game mechanics, at Facebook. Your career grows as you hack larger things.

And because Facebook is built on a lot of open source technologies, the skills you gain here are easily transferable everywhere.","Work / Life balance:

Almost all of them are very, very good. Down to about the 20th percentile of engineer, you can pretty much take their word as gold: if they say they'll do X in time Y, they will, and often a better X in a little less time than Y. This is a kind of super-power: it reduces the overhead of coordinating complex projects significantly.

Facebook is also a mission-focused organization, in the same sense that the military, or a relief agency is. Most employees understand the goal of the company to be larger than just making its employees and shareholders materially successful.

You will enjoy a vertiginous amount of authority as a front-line employee at Facebook. For better and for worse, on your first day at Facebook, you're given the keys to the proverbial Ferrari; you can push code, fix bugs, implement features, and yes, crash the site as much as any other engineer. Many user-facing decisions end up getting made by individual engineers.

This also implies that your work will have impact. Almost everyone you meet in your daily life is a user of your software. If they are unhappy users, it is your fault and responsibility to make it better. If they are happy users, you can enjoy your share of the credit.

All the basics (salary, equity, career advancement, food, miscellaneous perks like shuttles from SF) are world-class as well.","A mission-oriented job is not for everybody. If you are looking for a paycheck, and a ton of time to pursue your model railroading hobby, Facebook is going to be a weird fit for you.

For example, I see good engineers not going anywhere with their career even though they do good work, while I see average ones advance up the ranks if they make it a point to post in FYI for every feature they create.

You also have less of a chance to make an impact as a new hire since you're more likely to work on existing features rather than new ones.

If you joined about a year ago, your stock grant was over valued (by about 2x), so you're making a lot less than if you go to another company.

I've learned so much more than I did at my past company in a similar amount of time, have almost never been disappointed with the caliber of a co-worker (and I've worked somewhat closely with around 50 other engineers) and have gotten to contribute the product as a clip I wouldn't have believed possible. As an engineer I felt like I had a lot of control and influence over my work and the products I worked on and got to create some of the most impactful and satisfying products and features of my career, past and probably future. If you're really great at what you do or have really great product ideas, very little will interfere with you showing that quickly. New engineers are highly valued in the culture.

Salary/bonus compensation has been really strong in addition to the stock compensation.","I've felt like I've been able to maintain a pretty good work life/balance (especially after the first year), but I feel like I had to work hard to make that happen. Being around many people who feel compelled to put most of their waking weekday hours into coding can be intimidating, even when you feel confident in the job you're doing and even when pressure to put in a ton of hours is rarely explicit. Engineers can definitely work reasonable hours, especially older ones with families, but you have to bring your own self-confidence to trust that you're kicking butt even if you're not putting in a ton of hours (especially during the summers when interns ratchet up the intensity around the office)

Things are done very fast, which also means things can be hectic and sometimes chaotic (though this feels less and less true as the years go by), but I'd expect some culture shock for anyone coming from software companies where stability and consensus are top-priorities.

People. Some of the smartest people I have ever had a chance to deal with. Hard-working, fun, collaborative, creative and driven. They are not all made from the same mold and diversity is important. In Dublin, I love the multicultural environment, it is respectful of everyone's culture and creates a great vibe around the office. 

Perks. Alright so the initial salary is not the highest compared to other companies I have worked for. However, the 6 monthly bonuses (performance based), stock, salary adjustment every year, free healthy delicious food all day really add up. I have had higher base salaries in previous jobs, but going to work every day without fearing what the day brings, and lower stress-levels are just priceless.

Work/life balance is good; lots of encouragement to take a break when you need it with a pretty high frequency of offsite events, and flexible working hours.

The onboarding process is very well put together: culture infusion from the moment you walk in the door, and you're mentored through a six week bootcamp and can be pushing code out to the website in your first week.","The flip side of the low friction management structure is that you need to take on more ownership of finding high impact work--don't expect to handed out work, you need to identify the work and then get it done.

Having a high density of smart folks can make it feel more competitive than it really is, and that combined with the pretty low average age of employees can result in the occasional abrasive conversation.

By far the biggest Pro is that Facebook Engineering honestly and genuinely believe that it is super important that you are working on something that you are passionate about, and so we do our utmost to ensure that engineers have the opportunity to sample a wide range of the many options available to them, not only when they're new to Facebook during Bootcamp, but also throughout their time at Facebook. We do this because we strongly believe that people will do their best work when they are working on something they are truly passionate about. This is, for example, one of the driving forces behind hackathons. There is very little of the kingdom building one sees at other companies, and individual career advancement is always placed ahead of team stability. Unlike our fellow engineers over at the Chocolate Factory in Mountain View, where engineers are mostly assigned to teams, we actively encourage our engineers to seek out places and teams where they will have the highest potential to make an impact.","The food.

- Fun job most of the times.
- Great facilities and office location.
- You really learn how to work in a stressful environment and to manage different tasks.
- Opportunities to grow and travel.
- It looks good on your CV when you look for another job.","- Despite the mission, the company is not transparent towards employees. Goals are not clear, there's lots of backstabbing and favouritism. Reviews are anonymous, managers extract the paragraphs that suit them best and nobody knows how their job is really rated. 
-Management is terrible. Most managers are completely inexperienced, only focused on their career and and couldn't care less about their team.
-Hard work is not valued. It's all about the way you fake how much you find the company ""awesome"". There are managers who go to work at 11.30am every day and barely do any work, but because they are very good at faking their enthusiasm for the company, they are still there. 
- They don't want people who are honest and straightforward. They claim ""constructive criticism"" is welcome, but it's a lie. If you want to progress, you have to fake that you are ok with everything. I was once told by a manager ""criticism here is not accepted"" (guess when I decided I wanted to leave the company..).
- Their attempt to brainwash people is frightening: employees have to participate in ""wow moments"" (they say,"" wow, I work for FB, the company does this and that""..yes, it's true..), fill in the ""awesomeness index"" and give stuffed animals to people who perform well. 
- Work-life balance is very poor: working longer hours is the rule, your boss is on your Facebook, whatever you do is observed (remember Orwell's 1984? well, the guy was totally right). 
- The job is quite fun but can be extremly stressful, as you deal with any kind of violent, pornographic, very graphic content and there's no concrete support whatsoever for employees. You might be told at 5.30 pm that there are still 500 reports about suicidal content lying in the queue (oh yes, you'll sleep very well that night..). No wonder most people suffer from insomnia, see psychologists and have stress related diseases. 
- If you work in Dublin, bear in mind the main decisions are taken in Palo Alto and you're just the operational part of the company. You may work very hard on a project and discover at the end of the quarter that people in Palo Alto have already changed the policy without saying anything and your project is useless (...""All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others"")
- They call fast-paced environment what is most often simply a chaotic and illogical schizophrenia of decisions and counter decisions.","Be the example. Do you want to the company to be ""open and transparent""? Well, be open and transparent. 

Start thinking with your own minds and allow other people to do the same. 

Finally, my last piece of advice is, read George Orwell and ask yourself some questions.
