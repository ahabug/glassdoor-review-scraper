That said, stay away from Research Operations. I have never seen such poor, uninspiring, thoughtless leadership in my career. Multiple ICs have had to take extended leave because they could not take the abuse from management and were broken down to the point where they felt they had no value. Managers are reported to HR repeatedly, without any action taken. Leadership on that team would rather defend managers to the death than support an IC. There are at least two similar reviews on Glassdoor about this team.",Dissolve the research ops team and outsource that work to contractors. The pulse scores are consistently in the tank even pre-Covid. Most people would welcome the severance check and the freedom.,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

The company is large and has become very bureaucratic like any other large organization.

Censorship, and toxic culture in general. You can't be open unless you support a particular side. People have been driven out by the toxic culture for having wrong opinions, unless they are able to suppress themselves. 
As engineers you will have to constantly look for what to work on, this adds extra responsibilities. There are very less product managers, program managers, etc., so all those responsibilities have to be taken by engineers.

Lots of interesting product development happening consistently.","Productivity suite is chaotic / not standardized across teams (takes a lot of time managing personal comms), sometimes it can feel TOO people oriented (very surprising what can be said to managers and Zuck himself that is honestly flat out disrespectful but tolerated...also, lots of entitlement - particularly at lower levels that can make managing teams/talent tiresome). For mid-career professionals (L5-L6 in particular), advancement is tougher as the company gets bigger/evolves; seems like there are more growth opportunities for junior levels (in terms of promo: L2/L3) and senior levels (in terms of new areas of learning/expansion: L8/D1+). For SOME people, the high ambiguity, fast pace, and 99% self-determination of one's career will not fit their personal preferences. For me personally, it works well. But I have friends at the company who are quite frustrated/unhappy due to the lack of tops-down order and seemingly chaotic shifting of priorities and strategies.

There is constant censorship on the intra-Workplace conversations, discrimination during PSC, and worst the silent exiting of employees that frame BIPOCs to be resigning.

- With such rapid growth, inept individual contributors were forced into management positions and now they spend all their time trying to keep their friends at the top and everyone else in desperation to advance. This also means there are far too many bad managers

It is very difficult to get selected for this job, so this is one of my most memorable accomplishments. You're not really in until you've trained and passed a mock call. Definitely not an easy mock call. Not alot of my training class went on to continue working there. The work environment was relaxed, business casual dresscode required, but it just felt easygoing on the floor, not all high stress, high powered call floor where everyone is yelling sales stats and talking crazy to a potential client to get the sale. They continued on the job trainings as necessary. There were many opportunities for lateral moves, and promotions. Sadly, the reason I had to leave was because of a family emergency, that became an ongoing issue.","What was offered to potential clients may have been a bit too costly.

★★★★★
Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,3,"- Decent peers
- Metrics driven culture
- Global impact
- Lots of teams to choose from","- Terrible WLB: This depends on the team but generally FB hires less people per product compared to peers, so the amount of work is always high for PMs. Privacy, compliance, integrity, policy and similar regulatory stuff, albeit much needed, has added a ton of work, but the expectation of shipping fast is still there. Which means no WLB. Many 15+ hour days in a month are common.
- Low growth: Hard to become a people manager in this company unless you’re really lucky.
- Leveling is a total mystery. People who advance are usually those whose managers are willing to give them a great review at any cost.
- Middle management is filled with old timers who've never worked anywhere else, or some people who probably got in because they knew someone. Decision making is horrible leading to a lot of teams with tons of churn and low morale.
- No patience to build lasting products. Projects that need nurturing are shelved and the only ones that continue are those that Zuck personally cares about. You have 6 months to show massive progress, or else your product is done. 
- Reorgs are as common as oxygen at FB. This causes a ton of headache to have to re-start every so often.
- Business has serious headwinds due to things like signal loss caused by privacy climate and anti-trust legislation.","- Do an audit of middle management and let go of people with terrible reviews.
- Find ways to grow product managers
- Focus on WLB of your PMs by hiring more, being more realistic on timelines.
- Invest more in long-term bets and stop re-orging every 6 months.
- Your 5 values say nothing about being supportive to one another, creating a workplace that people love working at and that shows in the way your culture has evolved.",2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

Former Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,0,"Awesome place to learn about engineering and management. At least, in a big company at scale.

You can almost live on campus. I guess I mostly spent on rent and gas. Free food, showers, gym, ~700 dollars on external wellness activity, paternity leave, and lots of small perks to simplify your life.

FB fosters quite a friendly culture. At least, on the level of engineers. Semiannual reviews partially evaluate how good your relationships with the colleagues.

FB is very good at employee retention. Management will try hard to find interesting projects for you. Lots of projects that may bring a great impact. Quite unique projects at scale. 

Lots of pocket communities with interesting activities.

Good compensation.","Lots of big politics around the company. There is always pressure from the government, society, the media, and even from own employees represented by a vocal left-leaning group. You will also get the part of this pressure as an employee. 

Noisy environment. Sometimes it's good to have people around, but often you'll find yourself distracted. The company likes open spaces, MPK 20 is a living nightmare, though MPK 21 was designed better.

No digital nomad options, except big work-from-home mode right now.

Code quality is diverse. Some open-source libraries/frameworks are brilliant. Check folly or react. The non-public part totally depends on the team.

HQ, the biggest part of the company, is located in Menlo Park. The place has a nice nature around but has certain issues with the rent price, infrastructure, and gender ratio.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,2,Good Benefits and flexible work arrangment,"I have enjoyed working at Facebook but as a POC, I do feel that the lack of diversity has affected the quality of work we do, and diluted the creative culture at Fb. Creative teams across the company are very white, and mostly male. While I'm excited to see more roles open up in Facebook for creatives, I worry that it affords teams and management opportunities to hire more white people. Instead of bringing in someone with a different experience that is talented and deserving of an opportunity. Sadly, I've seen BIPOC candidates get shortlisted, only to not make the cut for arbitrary reasons. 'Not a good fit' is a poor reason for someone who spent the time interviewing with us with a stella portfolio. I worry that teams are only bringing in certain candidates to meet some sort of quota or to appear ""exhaustive"" in their search, just so that they can hire another white person. I'm tried of observing these performative acts of diversity from creative leaders across teams and hope that this changes. We can do better, we should do better.",Introduce more ways to hold teams and creative leaders accountable so that we are continuously assessing the health of the culture here at Fb.

Make no mistake, however, working at Facebook is not easy, and it's not for everyone.

There are processes that one would think should be in place by now that are not. Ways of working can be complex with lots of gray areas that can sometimes slow work down.

0,1,0,5 October 2020,23:08:51,Impact Work Internally and Externally, Program Manager,"Menlo Park, CA",,full-time, more than 5 years,3,"In no particular order, here are some pros that come to mind:

1. Surrounded by very smart, experienced people, who are top in their field

2. A lot of non-tech opportunities, esp. for those who are not SWEs such as folks in HR, Operations, Research, Recruiting, Branding, etc.

3. Supportive employee resource groups such as Black@ and BlackWomen@ which I found has helped me a lot as a black woman living in the Bay

4. Global cross-functional teams collaboration, and worldly impact of the work I do. I'm non-tech, and I still get to work with engineers and other orgs on projects and even get to hack with them in Hackathons!

5. Candid and tough conversations are carried out within the company among employees using Workplace, which have led to overall updates to policies, and also in the products and services we provide to people globally. It's not always pretty or easy to do (sometimes it can get bumpy); but the fact that we can have these discussions in our teams and from Zuck as a company means a lot to me, especially coming from my experience in the past where my leaders didn't even acknowledge current events and the plight of others.

6. Benefits and Perks! There are so many amazing benefits that have truly saved me-- medical insurance, mental health support through Lyra (for you and family members) have helped so much especially during Covid times. 

7. So many other things other than Facebook, Instagram and Oculus to work on! The company has grown and work that we do esp. in AR/VR keeps me excited to work here, as well as research that we're doing.","1. Sometimes moving so fast can caused projects (non-tech) to experience multiple iterations when a longer time line may have yielded a ""one-and-done"" result

2. Would love more diversity and people of color in higher leadership positions. 

3. With the increase in company size over a short span of time, I've notice that there are folks that are hired on that do not align with our mission and values. This can cause tension within the teams, and some managers do not address these head on.

4. On some occasions work week can be quite long, from my experience. When dealing with a global project with multiple stakeholders, hours of work can be a pain esp. when you're in late night meetings or early morning (i.e 1AM PST when with APAC for example.). I find this more of a given depending on your role however.","Let's go back to being leaders in tech and policies! When it comes to racism and systemic racism amongst people of color in the U.S., and groups, politicians that post false information to instigate, I don't think it should take us so long to action (i.e. Twitter banning /fact checking politician posts that are false... before FB did).",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,0,"One of the biggest perks is working with some of the most intelligent, thoughtful and honest coworkers anywhere in the world. No matter how big of a fish you have been in previous ponds, you will be a small fish here and have incredible space to grow. There is incredible freedom to pursue the projects you want in the way that you want as long as you can defend why they are important to the company. While less than it was in the past, there is incredible transparency and accountability from leadership internally. Your manager will support and promote you in a way that is unprecedented at most other companies. Most importantly, the work you do affects millions or billions of people - even seemingly tiny tasks like making the app update 1 second faster or tweaking a model to deliver 1% more interesting content can have a large positive impact on the world. While it doesn't always succeed, the company takes diversity and social justice seriously and it shows in project initiatives and hiring.","It's a big company with entrenched (if sometimes informal) power structures. As much as people try to be transparent, there are backdoor politics that affect your role and career that you might not learn about until much later, if ever. There will be constant pressure to specialize - many of the new skills I've developed here would transfer well to other big tech companies, but be wasted at a startup. Work life balance can go sideways quickly unless you protect yourself zealously. Even in the ""move fast (and we no longer say 'break things')"" culture there is a lot of pressure to not mess up in ways that affect the public negatively - even small mistakes in privacy or integrity have terrible negative effects on potentially millions of people.","Get way ahead of privacy and integrity trends - we're usually reactive to anything that affects the top line, we should do a lot more speculative research on ways to protect free speech, squash misinformation, and protect user identity - all at the same time, even though those things often trade off poorly.",5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,0,"High comp, excellent benefits, smart people","This company works you so hard that you can't ever see the bigger picture. I think this is on purpose so you never notice your complicity in the bad things the company enables. They also compensate you well so it's hard to leave for a lower paying job. They also lied about the hours during my interview. First year expectations are for you to work extremely hard for 10-12 hours/day with little to no support. This is worse for people who come in at more senior levels. If you have a good job now, do not leave it to go to FB because of higher pay. I wish I hadn't.","The company pays a lot of lip service to employee wellness, but mid-level managers are always trying to justify their jobs by demanding new reports, plans, and strategies. This is made worse by the high turnover at various levels of management, meaning that every time a new manager comes in, they need to be brought up to speed. These operational tasks are so frequent with relatively no lead-time that long-term product work suffers enormously. 

The company would benefit from managers taking a longer view and giving their teams enough uninterrupted time to execute on the management's strategy.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, less than a year,1,- The people are nice,"- Not Invented Here is pervasive and basic tools are often rewritten for little, if any, gain
- Open source is not valued. Open Source is only done when the company sees a direct benefit like sharing code with vendors or when an advocate is willing to fight through all the red tape
- The company advocates a work/life balance, but expextations are not reasonable for a 40 hour week
- Code quality is extremely low. There is little empasis on quality so long as it works
- Developer and process tooling is all custom and buggy resulting in a lot of externa workarounds
- Internal training is low quality and external training is the same budget as swag. There is no tuition reimbursement
- The company says to be your authentic self, but if you don't drink the Kool-aid you're going to have a bad time
- The company is driven by semi-annual performance reviews that create perverse incentives which emphasize impact over quality and short term over long term goals.
- There are too many meetings and most are run inefficiently
- The company uses Workplace (Facebook for work) for internal communications which, like Facebook, has a low signal to noise ratio unless you ignore most things
- The company is process heavy in many areas but the only way things get done is when people ignore the processes",Listen to employee concerns. Embrace a more mature culture.,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

Gaslighting and abuse is rampant in this department evidenced by the rapid turnover and mismatched culture compared to the rest of Facebook. Managers are bullies and not inclusive especially if you do not fit the white, frat boy stereotype. If you do not drink the ""kool aid"" or atleast pretend to drink it, you will be ostracized.

There is no pressure from the organization to work after hours and using your PTO and leave options is greatly encouraged. 

I personally love the casual and open culture. When they say ""bring your whole self to work"" they mean it. Coming from a more traditional company it took a little time to adapt to this as well as to adjust to how people communicate with each other but now I'm hooked.

Facebook is not a good place to work if you're a parent, there was no empathy for having to take time to deal with kid things during COVID when my partner and I were both working full time.

- The candor and openness of culture (which can be con in trying times - see note below)
- Caliber of talent. I have truly never worked at a company where there is such a high minimum bar for both competence and kindness.","Given Facebook's historical ""move fast"" and autonomous culture, there are a lot of byproducts that make it more difficult to work here than you would expect at this size of company:
- Disparate tooling ecosystem and preference for homegrown tools over enterprise tools (which has lots of positives, but in many regards it means reinventing the wheel and bugs)
- Siloed teams working on similar things, but not knowing of or talking to each other

The other main con is information overwhelm. As a social media company, Facebook is in a unique position to influence and have a stake in social issues that have global impact. For better or worse, that means divisive opinions in the world coexist and are surfaced within the walls of the company and all over our internal workplace. It's hard not to get caught up in this and ""focus on work"" when a lot of what's been surfaced is so deeply engrained in what our product does and/or how our culture should be.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4.0,5.0,Approves of CEO,,Approves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than 8 years,2,"- The engineering culture is still very bottom-up: teams generally have a lot of power and responsibility to determine what they work on.
- Internal developer tools are a huge focus. Anything which slows developers down is fixed if possible.
- Very good internal mobility: bootcamp means you have a good deal of leeway in finding a team, and, after a year internal mobility is encouraged.
- Tons of opportunities to make millions of peoples' lives just a little bit better. Like it or not, Facebook's products are used by over a billion people worldwide. There are few places where improvements and fixes can have such a broad reach.
- Lots of intellectual challenges: There are many types of challenges in building products for billions of people: technical (scaling and perf), product (how do you make it useful for everyone), regulatory (how to not fall afoul of privacy regulations), security (how to minimize badness that happens due to the products), and more.","The biggest challenge facing Facebook right now is that it is simultaneously too big to run the way it runs now (with teams trying to fight for impact and all hacking on the same products), and too small to fit with the well-intentioned goals that Mark has for all of the ways that Facebook can help people.

A company without any strong sense of unifying purpose tends toward bloat and stagnation. It feels like this is the direction Facebook is heading.

They are very heavy on KPIs to an agency-level.
The scope of the job is also very narrow due to the size of the org, so you very quickly find yourself bored and although I undoubtedly was learning some new skills, I was losing some I valued that I had acquired in previous roles.

Solid name recognition for future jobs
Top notch perks","Leadership moves from crisis to crisis to crisis. The attention focus is relatively short on the hot issue of the moment and that trickles down to every org. You can be working on the number 1 goal or project from Jan - June and knock it out of the park. Then by July everyone's attention has shifted and your work is no longer relevant. A lot of institutional knowledge is lost this way. 

The company skews young as well, so there are a lot of inexperienced people who want to make their mark/get their promotions and they work hard but don't get the guidance that would help them work smarter. The result is that some teams take ""done is better than perfect"" and ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" to another level, which can make work tedious. Almost everyone comes from elite schools and has great stats so some really lean in extra hard into making themselves stand out, sometimes in ways that aren't the most useful or healthy. 

There's also a hierarchy Technical people on top, then Business people (cause they make the money) then lawyers then everyone else. People in ops often are at the bottom of the totem pole.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,25,"Free food, clothing, beer, perks","Avoid data center/infrastructure areas of the company. Rampant turnover - Facebook hires overqualified people and places them in incredibly boring, tactical roles with very little growth. With that, my first six months on the job, I saw extremely high turnover, and not only that, but managers were angry, defensive and vengeful when people left their teams.
Management sells grandiose visions of their team to team members - Management always mentions that their team is the “best” and that we are more coveted than that team.” I realize this was management’s way of overcompensating for the lack of impact and boring nature of their team as well as poor retention issues.
Management thinks they’re perfect - When they receive multiple below average pulse scores, instead of trying to “solve” the underlying issue, in this case growth and fulfillment of their employees, they try to play detective and figure out who rated them poorly and then use it against them during performance reviews. You are not perfect, and you are not god.
People are blocked from transferring by managers and are retaliated against during performance reviews if they express interest to leave a team. I spoke to a guy who left my team for consumer hardware, and he told me had to go to HR because the manager took it so personally. I personally was retaliated against when I expressed interest to leave a team. Warning: you cannot have an open discussion with your manager about switching teams. Managers will take this personally and then retaliate against you in performance reviews claiming you are an under performer and not committed to their team. They would rather you leave the company, then transfer as this would reflect poorly on them.
Performance at Facebook is like a popularity contest. You have to talk up and chat with leaders in the company, “play the game”, and be well liked. Your rating is dependent on the number of advocates you have in the room. Your “perceived” performance is more important than your actual performance.",Retention is poor on your teams so promote career mobility internally,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,,No Opinion of CEO,,,

Former Employee ",full-time, less than a year,0,"All 3 interviews were conducted on the same day. However, they were scheduled from 11:45am till 1:30pm without any breaks to drink water or grab a bite.","It’s so ironic to see that Facebook’s career site clearly states that for them DIVERSITY is not an option, but: 

1. Their interview panelists and hiring managers were all caucasians
2. They continue to hire caucasians 

Also, during the interview process the interviewers mentioned that take diversity very seriously. However, I’m a diversity candidate (born in Cuba, have an accent, and openly meme we of the LGBTQ community) and the 3 caucasians interviewers selected a white American born candidate instead. 

How can you avoid unconscious bias in a recruitment process when the ones interviewing and making hiring decisions are not from a diversity background?","Make sure that your words match your actions. If you care about diversity and inclusion, then start by giving diversity employees the opportunity to be part of the interview process. This will avoid bias and ensure alignment with your organization values. 

Don’t say that you care about a diverse and inclusive workforce when you continue to hire people with the same color of the skin as yours, they talk and behave like you. 

Be transparent with candidates from the beginning and provide them with qualitative and quantitative feedback so they can work on themselves and improve for future interviews. 

With that said, IF YOU ARE A WHITE CANDIDATE BORN IN THE USA AND YOU INTERVIEW WITH THE TALENT ACQUISITION TEAM IN CHICAGO, YOU’LL HAVE HIGHER CHANCES OF GETTING SELECTED. 

On the other hand and unfortunately, IF YOU’RE FROM ANOTHER ETHNIC BACKGROUND AND YOU HAVE AN ACCENT, YOU WONT BE SELECTED.

Current Employee ",full-time, less than a year,4,"The compensation is good but you'll spend most of it paying for housing in and around the Bay area. Also helps that you can offset your food expenses at home if you eat on campus. I'm based in MPK so the on/off campus perks are a plenty. You got gyms, an onsite dental / eye clinic, a massage therapist, an acupuncturist, access to campus Ubers and shuttles, the many many food cafes, sweet shops, food trucks, dry cleaning, Ship-It, a nail salon and barber shop, a bike rental/bike repair shop, and if you need to learn how to bike lessons, you can get that too. AR/VR, a print shop, ERO groups, life-style sessions, micro-kitchens - God I miss the micro-kitchens, the numerous off-site perks and discounts, the Dogs@FB Workplace group, the Tiger King@FB Workplace group, the Sad Meals WFH@FB Workplace group, no formal dress code, a park on the roof, ginger shots, Mark's weekly Q&A, other Q&As with various leaders and world experts, work from your desk or work from some random spot, the library, the product vending machine, the FB 15+ cause of how much you'll eat, the health benefits for a single person with no dependents, company stock and 401K, company products (Portal, IG, etc.), and company swag. Yes this is a real review and no I'm not being paid to vomit sweet nothings. In truth, I've never worked for anything like FB and I've worked for some top notch companies at different phases in my life. I love my team, my peers, my org, my leaders. I know it's going to be hard for me to find a replacement should I, someday, decide to leave FB. And while I realize FB isn't rainbows and unicorns cause it has issues, anytime you have people of different ages, genders, nationalities, political leanings, etc. in one place you're going to have issues but its pretty damn close to perfect. I'm over 40 (I feel 20) so I understand that for others my outlook may be a bit different and hell who knows in a few years I may feel different about the company. One thing though, I don't regret the interview loops nor my decision to leave another top tech org in the Bay area. I look forward to FB's evolution and seeing it continue to be successful.","PTO is alright. The Performance Review process is stressful, feels like I'm prepping to take the SATs, GREs, LSAT or MCAT every 4 months. I'm saddened by the prospect that one day I may no longer view FB as a glorious place and like others pursue other shiny objects in hopes of making more money with less effort.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

I don't regret it at all, as internally you can see how everyone's trying their best to make this company useful for society at large (yes, making money at the same time, but definitely not as the primary driver of decisions being made).

You do things differently at FB, and you get to learn and explore many areas of true R&D, to eventually become a better engineer.

I've been at FB for about 6 months now, but I never saw/experienced such a company DNA before with respect, gratitude, kindness and awareness to bias.
People here are remarkable.

Former Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,65,"Free food, good salary, hype","At Facebook I got to know what ""gaslighting"" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"". This is part of this culture! 
There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. 
Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. 

Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. 
HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. 

Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking. I wish I never joined this scam of a company, a lousy swamp filled with ghosts who pretend to be humans!",,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,5.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

- You will feel challenged and have lots of runway to grow.
- The internal tools you'll use are way better than most company's tools or even many commercially-available tools.
- The perks speak for themselves. I mean free food tastes so much better than non-free food.
- The pay is some of the best in the industry
- The team I'm on has great work life balance (it's ALL about the team you choose)","- It seems this company skews a little younger. So some perks and company nuances you might not care about as much like free laundry (no thanks, I'll do my own) and dinner served around 6pm (no thanks, I'll have dinner with my family at home).
- Compared to other big tech, you'll see there's more emphasis on you actually working from the office (but many work 1 day per week from home). COVID-19 might change this. Since that, we've been working from home for an extended period.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,1,"- Working on high impact projects which are challenging and meaningful
- More flexibility with office locations than traditional SWE roles (e.g. there's EE teams in Austin but no SWE teams)
- Hard to imagine a better place to learn and grow as an engineer
- A lot of EE teams are continuously finishing projects and beginning new ones, so you can have a lot more variety in what you're working on (which makes it much easier in my opinion to choose projects which you find interesting or you want to learn more about)","- Hard to switch from EE teams to SWE teams (requires re-interviewing) if you're in one of the big Engineering offices
- Since traditional EE roles dealt more with things like Oracle development, you can get the feeling that EE is looked down on by SWE orgs. I think this is changing quickly as the role evolves and people realize the complex problems EE's are solving, but we're not there yet in terms of having the same 'prestige' as SWEs
- Deadlines can be tight depending on business needs
- It's on you to determine how much you want to work. This is a double edged sword because you can work a ton in order to drive quicker promotions, but also have to be proactive on forcing work/life balance as there's always more work you could be doing.","- Continue to take engineer's input in roadmap planning as we're often the front lines who see inefficiencies or problems first hand
- Do a better job advertising what Enterprise Engineering is and where open roles are, so SWE candidates who want to live in places like Austin know that Enterprise Engineering is an option",5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

4. Company is in an insecure state right now which trickles down to every level of management. Frequent back stabbing, anonymous feedback that harms you and bullying is rampant within teams. 
5. They rely on their ability as the world's largest social media site to get get talented people but do nothing to develop them or encourage honest and fair performance reviews.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,0,"I joined as an Enterprise Engineer and quickly became the manager after working with the engineers to boost productivity and overall happiness on the team.

Everyone on the team is motivated, talented and open to new ways of work. The team is very collaborative and flexible. This makes everyone very good to work with - we all want to achieve great results while maintaining good work/life balance.

We get the opportunity to work on very impactful projects. In our area we support the efficient and accurate payment of many billions of dollars per year. It's a great responsibility.

One of the great things I love is being able to work on software engineering projects in Austin for Facebook. While they don't officially allow software engineers in Austin at Facebook, Enterprise Engineering work is super close to the work I did previously as a software engineer at Facebook in Seattle.

The growth in Austin for Enterprise Engineering is also a great opportunity for me and my team - we get to be the ones determining the work culture here for engineering.","Ramping up within the domain takes some time. I wasn't immediately knowledgeable about things like the general ledger, period close, accruals, balance sheets and the like. While these may not be the most interesting topics, I do enjoying how my work reduces the tedium involved and makes sure the Facebook business runs smoothly.

As a remote office, we do have to sometimes coordinate across time zones. It's not often, but sometimes it does require meeting in the evening. As the manager I make sure these meetings are kept to only those really needed, both for maintaining our work/life balance and productivity.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Former Employee ",full-time, more than 5 years,8,"Facebook has a lot of Pro's but it really depends on the team you land on and the internal politics that surround that particular unit. That is no different than any other company but it can be night and day here.

Generally here are the Pros
- People: Majority of the other Facebookers are of high quality and surrounding yourself with other smart people can only up your own game.

- Benefits: Positive package here overall. They take care of your health, make some life task much easier and try to make life more comfortable.

- Technology: Innovative mindset is a big plus but recent years have been more mirror moves with competition to gain an advantage. Good move but for those that want to break the glass into new frontiers, you got to pick the right team.

Impact: The opportunity is there for you to embrace.","Generally here are the Cons:
- People / Culture: There is a small minority of leftist that can be loud and push activist agenda's that are in your face. While my own goals can align (leftist) I don't like their approach. This is just society creeping into the corporate world and is seen across Tech in general. It can be toxic and extremely disrespectful. You might find more of this at Facebook due to the nature of the product. Imagine the rest... Pick your team wisely.

- Weak Leadership: Lot of new leaders... Experienced leaders may not have much experience with trouble shooting negative situations and come in with a bias. Another point here is the number of Re-Orgs. You might experience multiple changes within a quarter / half and this can drag on for years. 

- Negative news cycle ... it can be draining but it should be a wake up call to further innovate for a product for today. However... this news cycle is long... I mean looooooong and can be intense at times.","Think longer than 6 month windows.

Employees are technically assessed on many aspects of performance, but the only one my manager focused on was lines of code.
- Competitive culture: Constantly talking about PSCs meant everyone on the team was afraid of any appearance that they did something wrong, which created a culture of blaming others and never admitting mistakes. Managers either stayed out of it or made it worse.
- Workload: My tech lead set deadlines that were too aggressive and didn’t listen when my teammates and I pushed back, so we were constantly behind schedule. Working late at night and on the weekends consistently was required just to remain a few months behind schedule.
- Asking for Help: Several members of my team had to ask for help writing code many times per day. Most of their questions could be quickly solved by typing a few words into a search bar and looking at the first result, but they still asked another engineer any time they encountered something they didn’t already know how to do. They would intentionally not ask managers and avoid asking for help while managers were within earshot.",Pay attention to signs of burn-out in employees.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,4,"The opportunity that Facebook offers for autonomy and career growth is incredible; coming in as a new grad PE I have the opportunity to grow based on merit and performance, not time in the role. 

Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. 

The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people.

My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee.

Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career.

The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas.

On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role.","As is the case with many large companies, some middle management fails to display leadership to a large extent. We should hire better senior managers and directors to embrace and evolve and relay the company vision and values.",5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

You have all you can imagine, access to shuttles, on-site dentist, paid laundry services, sweet shop. The tools, infrastructure and stack let's you be very productive. For instance, setting up a website where someone can input data on a form and storing the data in a DB takes minutes. 

An experience at this company will open many many doors for you, it will be much easier to get phone interviews. You will also learn a lot.","The culture is pretty bad and the performance review system is a joke. 

Unless you abide 100% by their culture, you can't be happy. This means you are not allowed to even question their principles. If you think something needs to be fixed at the root cause, you are in trouble, because you need to Move Fast! The company over-focuses on the short term speed rather than long term. 

I was lied to multiple time by management. I was told my rating depended on the reviews from my peers, but then when the perf came, I realized it is 100% up to the manager regardless of what your peers say. My manager told me constantly I was doing great, then perf came and because I questioned the principles, I had a bad rating. The 360 was useless, management can use if they want to promote you, but if you are not in great terms with your manager, the 360 will be ignored. 

I was also told multiple times, the company is impact-based and that what matters is impact. After working on a project with another manager, I was told I could not get any credit, since it was not 100% my idea.","Put a proper 360 system where the rating does not depend100% on the manager and actually takes impact and peer reviews into account.

Understand that the conpany principles (e.g. Move Fast, break things, be bold) are not applicable in all sotuations.

Former Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,124,"Facebook is a good company to work for. They pay well. They have great perks. At the beginning, life is good.

Facebook rewards ambition.","The appeal quickly wears off. Your experience at Facebook highly depends on the team you join.

Facebook does not have the best people managers. If you join a team with a good manager who knows the system, you will be more likely to have a productive, prosperous time at Facebook. If you join a team with a bad manager, your work-life balance will be horrible. You will feel extreme pressure with the Performance cycle review every six months. Worse yet, you may even blame yourself for what's happening, not realizing the role your manager plays until it is too late.

Facebook is a good company for new college graduates. Even with a bad experience, you can learn so much about practical, applied technology here. For those with several years of experience, or with family commitments, be careful. Come into Facebook with a clear sense of what you need from Facebook that you cannot get anywhere else. Be prepared to leave when that is delayed, or not a possibility, or comes at a cost to your family or external commitments.

For most people, Facebook is not a company that you join and happily work at for the rest of your life. Facebook is a temporary stop that will squeeze as much productivity out of you as it can. When that stops, it forces you out or makes you want to leave.",,2.0,1.0,5.0,,2.0,5.0,3.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

- Meet lots of cool people
- Good for your first job but if you are experienced coming from the outside be very careful as they don't value this.
- The FB experience varies widely between teams. I have friends who love their job and role on the team they are in. This wasn't the case for me. Your company is as good as your manager and I had no good ones.","1. Work/Life Balance
If you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams.

2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: 
(i) Managers fawning over each other showing ""impact"" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you.
(ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People ""strong arm"" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good.
(iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace.
(iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based
(v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done.
(vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary.

3. You are goaled a lot on ""collaboration"" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be ""happy"" and ""always on."" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system.

4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's ""XFN this"" and ""XFN that"" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on ""collaboration"" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be ""liked.""

5. GMS Summit - This event is a mix between Jonestown and being in North Korea. People stand up and applaud Zuckerberg when he comes on stage and don't sit down until he sits down.

I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture: The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People: Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management: Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.","Keep doing what you're doing and fight hard to not be complacent. I believe that humility is the key so don't ever lose that thinking. Your motives will always be suspect, but if you're able to look in the mirror everyday and know that your motives are pure, that's all that matters.

★★★★★
Former Employee ",full-time, less than a year,12,Health insurance is of excellent quality and a very fair price for employee contributions. The meals provided are of good quality and are free as are the snacks that are provided.,"(I worked in the Austin, Tx office under the Community Operations organization)

Rampant hostile political atmosphere
Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward. This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone. This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions. No one wins.

Sloppy processes
It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes. Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives). Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work. So much waste. No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.

No humanity in the human facing part of the org
Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center. People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help. We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.

Custom everything means sloppy everything
So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be! Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.

Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people
Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period. It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience). The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook. It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly. There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops. There is only ""What's in it for me?"" 

HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock
You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position). I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details. Kind of disappointing. 

Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet
When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place. But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain. It's frightening given how much power and authority Facebook has and I really hope that this issue is sorted before things go to far.","Be mindful of what behavior you are driving given the way expectations are set
Take a hard look at what Facebook says it wants to do and what it's really doing- are they aligned?
For Community Ops- the org is there to support the users of Facebook- the humans on the other side. I'd encourage you to take a deep walk into the org to see if the individual members are really thinking of those people when they do their work.",3.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,5.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,4,"FB-unique pros:
- Super flat culture. Weekly Q&As with execs that are really open and casual, purposeful de-emphasis on titles. The emphasis is on ideas and impact; aspiring meritocracy
- Fast pace! Some view this as a con, but if you are high-energy and easily bored like me, this is ideal. Plus, this includes fast career growth. If you can perform, you will be rewarded quickly.
- Great people! ""Brilliant jerk"" behavior, as seen in these kinds of companies, is generally less tolerated/prevalent here than elsewhere
- Generally best engineering pay among big-tech employers


Less unique pros you've probably heard of (still awesome):
- Top-class benefits (including INSANE parental benefits)
- Amazing tech infrastructure, a great place to go very tech-deep
- Campus is basically Disneyland","- Recent newsmedia. It's easy to either feel discouraged or develop a bit of an ""us versus them"" mentality when the media/public seem both technically ill-informed and antagonistic towards your company.
- It's an increasingly mature company, which means the pace is (slowly) slowing down. This affects the culture; fewer people are mission-driven or down for a passionate ""hacker"" culture.","Keep up the [Mark's] recent push to ""take the offensive"" and evangelize the company's principles! Employees recognize the need for increasing work with regulators, but we broadly don't think that a continued ""apology tour"" is helpful (or warranted). We love being mission-driven and publicly aligned with you.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

* Recruiting tools are literally the best in the business.","* The pressure to perform is insane; hitting my target + delivering on projects was just barely enough to get a meets all during the perf cycle
* Roles are becoming increasingly small and marginalised as the team continues to scale. As a result, you see people jumping (literally) on to projects to set themselves apart from the rest of the team. It makes for a bit of a cut-throat culture just around the time when PSC hits
 * If you're interviewing at facebook, prepare for a ride with R4R - they'll probably won't speak to you again after you've signed the contract
* While there are exceptions, the culture in the recruiting team is just weird. It sort of reminds me of high school. There's cliques, people gossip and there's for sure a couple of bullies: either people wouldn't even say a word to you or would go out of their way to make you feel like you're weird or different (to be honest, that also included my manager).
* Ads Credits & being forced to dog-food beta apps: I'm a huge instagram fan and big user - so being forced to update my apps multiple times a day was a nightmare.

Fast promotion if you can work long hours. 

Fast paced environment, you'll get to learn new stuff all the time. Lot of smart engineers around.","With fast promotion comes fast firing. It's up or out policy up to a certain level. 

Not a good place for senior engineers joining. Too much stress in the team driven by performance reviews, which is the most aggressive that I've ever known. Emphasis is on individual impact, due to which there's lot of distrust within the team. No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. 

There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication.

Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year.

This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired. Most of the engineers work to satisfy performance reviews. My work is determined keeping performance review as the guideline.

Former Employee ",full-time, more than a year,1,"Free food, tshirts, good pay, benefits","To me, the culture was deceptive and backstabbing, and my org lacked accountability for management practices and pathways to fix problems.","Disclaimer: This is my opinion, based on firsthand experiences and observations while working at the company. My situation may have been wildly different from that of other employees, but I can only review what I experienced. 

I think the company could benefit from promoting candidness among the workforce instead of relying on propaganda and groupthink. I'd also like to see Facebook hire outside consultants to clean house and remove clusters of horrible managers, employees, processes, etc. I'm not the first to say it: Facebook is no longer a quirky startup and should probably stop acting like one.

For me, working at Facebook featured the ""fake it til you make it"" scheming of Elizabeth Holmes mixed with the incompetence and denial of the USSR during Chernobyl... disguised as the paradise from The Good Place (spoiler alert, it's actually hell).

I felt that the job Facebook sold to me during recruitment simply didn't exist. Instead, my duties were embarrassingly ridiculous. I found myself working off-hours on non-essential tasks that any middle school student with no professional experience could have accomplished (seriously). The culture of blatant misrepresentation and kool aid drinking seemed so prevalent that I regularly saw new employees realize within weeks of on-boarding that they had been duped into taking nightmare jobs. The practice of awarding large relocation bonuses (which must be paid back if an employee quits before 1 year) seemed like a great perk but left unhappy employees unable to leave without owing huge sums of money. 

Though I was bombarded with slogans and propaganda from day one, such as ""feedback is a gift,"" it seemed clear to me that only sugarcoated, ""positive"" feedback would be tolerated. Management never wanted to hear about problems (though there were so, so many) and used some of the most creepy and passive aggressive fear tactics I've ever seen to keep employees' mouths shut about anything that wasn't seen as complimentary. This was not just my perception of the situation. I was outright advised by managers to only promote myself and omit anything negative in group settings to be seen as a team player. Why a company would expend massive amounts of money to hire industry experts, only to have them ignored, under-utilized, and treated like garbage by unintelligent managers was beyond me. 

It also seemed to me that it was not uncommon to see employees with greater education and industry (or even managerial) experience than their supervisors. More than a few managers also appeared to have poorly-defined and redundant roles. This created the worst type of dynamic, which Facebook encouraged employees to work around by ""managing up."" In other words, employees with greater skills or insight but no power were supposed to somehow make up for the shortcomings of their bosses.... an impossibility in a system that effectively operated as a rigid, top-down hierarchy.

To me, the vague leadership roles also caused managers to essentially have to compete with their reports for credit and attention, which could easily make the worst among them feel threatened and lash out. I witnessed managers gossiping in meetings to try and ruin their own employees' reputations (see below ratings section). It also seemed common for even mid-level management (who seemed to be constantly jetting around the world on useless self-promotion tours) to take low level employees' work and spin it into wildly inaccurate tales of success for personal gain. 

The rating and promotion system? I thought it was a joke of a popularity contest akin to the Black Mirror episode Nosedive. Management might not have been capable of providing any real feedback about skills or performance, but they wouldn't hesitate to let an employee know if he or she wasn't smiling enough or making enough cross-functional buddies. 

Everyone at the company was required to seek out performance reviews from numerous other employees twice per year, which I felt kept people behaving like phony robots incapable of constructive discourse. From what I could see, the system lacked objective standards or oversight, which stifled improvement and seemed to allow networks of awful employees to keep one another afloat. I was blown away by how many low performers managed to stick around and secure jobs for their extended network, spreading like a cancer.

To make matters worse, I did not find that the company had an effective system of checks and balances for bad managers, and it seemed like employees were usually too scared to leave honest reviews for their bosses or organizations during performance review cycles or climate surveys. Why? Because warnings from veterans of the company, the treatment of perceived ""troublemakers,"" and occasionally direct comments by management communicated that anyone who tried to rock the boat would be punished. Punishment in such a passive aggressive environment usually took the form of sudden and unexplained negative performance feedback (resulting in lower bonuses and probably a career tailspin), hateful gossip, extra busywork, and/or constant harassment and micromanagement by supervisors who would start finding problems with everything or requiring permission for even the smallest tasks. 

I've never worked somewhere where so many of my colleagues regularly burst into tears (or rages), either because they felt like hostages to bosses who'd have them working on useless, self-serving projects late into night, or because they felt their supervisors were trying to torpedo their careers or reputations behind their backs. These employees would then have to pull themselves together enough to smile at a meeting to avoid further negative feedback. In my view, it was truly a disgusting environment, at odds with the gushy pro-Facebook culture posters plastered everywhere. 

My advice to people considering working at Facebook would be to be very VERY careful about where you end up at the company. Do not ignore your gut or any red flags that pop up during hiring. Make sure the compensation and sparkly perks will be worth it in the event that you find yourself working insane hours on nonsense, being regularly demeaned by a knuckle dragger of a boss. If you live in the Menlo Park area, the money won't actually go that far, and your options if you hire onto a bad team may be nonexistent. You'd likely have to endure whatever abuse is thrown at you and reach a certain level of social impressiveness just to remain with the company long enough to switch to another team. I couldn't get out fast enough.",1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,5.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

The good thing is that you are surrounded by so many intelligent people, the vast majority of whom are willing to help, especially when you're new.

One of policies is an openness - this includes famous weekly Q&As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. 

In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news.

Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). 

There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good. I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!), split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others.

Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work.",It would be good to have another campus in East Bay - somewhere in Dublin / Pleasanton area.,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, less than a year,0,"I've only just started with Facebook, but I'm truly humbled to be part of the team! For me it starts first and foremost with the mission: to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. I love this mission and while I've worked in other great companies in the past with great missions too - this by far - is the mission that relates most to me as an individual. It's powerful. It's empowering. It's enriching. It's transformative. Not just for me but for so many people we share the world with today but also tomorrow. What I love about it is I believe Facebook and its family of apps: Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, etc, and other technologies like it from other companies are transforming the medium of language, the medium of communication. I can remember being a young boy in the early 80's in a small city called Waterford, in the south of Ireland, being excited when introduced to the humble CD for the first time. I remember clearly the first mobile brick hand-phones, mpeg players, ipods, on and on and on. With the advent of AR/VR and the proliferation global messaging apps that connect huge parts of the world today I'm feeling a similar excitement here seeing first hand the impact these technologes are having for billions of people on the planet. I'm really enjoying being in a company not just playing a huge part in this evolutionary transformation but doing so in a company from what I can see so far is doing so with real respect for its employees. The work environment is safe, collaborative and fair. There are large degrees of flexibility, autonomy and transparency. Folks are humble and authentic, at least the ones I've all met so far, and they deeply care about their work and those people around them. I'm only new, so I'll need more to understand the company as the weeks, months and years go by, but so far so good and I'm delighted to be joining at such an early stage of its growth.",None yet.

Facebook is for sure a great company, but my experience in BI was really bad. Please, see below the main cons of this team:
 1)Management: Inexpert management, really superficial and high level approach, luck of clear direction, unprofessional jokes and attitude, play favourites, only interest in their own goals and not the development of the team
- Lack of structure: No processes & structures, many teams have been created without a prior consultant opinion. So many people, me included, have been obliged to work in a team not fitting their skills.
- Not all the opinions are heard: If you try to propose new projects ideas and . process you can result annoying. They ask people of higher level to be independent and drive their own initiatives, but at the end the managers decide and promote only the people that help them to reach their own goals.
- Team collaboration: we are all great talent and characters, but the lack of job together with the managers inconsistency created un-healthy competition and back stubbing environment","- Please be more professional: We are not a group of friends!!! Bad jokes on the city where someone comes from or arrogant commenta are not acceptable in a great company as Facebook
- Work more on written processes and workflows that enable same expectations for everyone
- Improve People skills: start to listen the opinions of all team members, care more about their needs and their desire to growth and make things impactful and meaningful for them instead of thinking solely to your own interests!",1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,5.0,1.0,,,,,,
