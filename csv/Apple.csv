- huge lack of diversity. Everyone looks different, but thinks the same. It is kind of like the stepford wives. Lots of smiles and niceness, just don’t mention anything politically moderate or right leaning.
- because of all of the above, it isn’t uncommon to see employees emotionally and verbally abuse other employees for taking a stand for something that doesn’t align with identitarian intersectional ideology.","Create a DNA for conservatives. Apple says they are “for everybody” in their values but fail miserably for people who are more conservative leaning. There have been so many people I’ve known who would say, “I am just using this place” or “this place will never accept me.” Lots of talent is lost in this manner, and having people who have been successful yet conservative at Apple guide you through understanding and navigating the terrain will help keep some talent.

My immediate reporting manager was amazing as was my store manager/HR. Most of the time sales were easy.","INADEQUATE TRAINING. I was someone who started without an abundance of tech knowledge. My team taught me something new every day, all day. Normally a good thing but not great when the store is swamped (which frequently happens) and you're essentially on your own. Still retail, Same challenges with any other retail position: Unrealistic hours (cant exactly be helped. Weekends and nights), Not enough Pay to scrape by (On the higher side of retail though.) ""Unspoken"" sales/business intro/apple accessory + service quotas. Zero incentive to achieve a top position in any previously mentioned categories, aside from recognition. Any advancement WILL require some outside education. Apple/ Store sponsorship does exist to some varying degree. Apple corporate and Apple retail are two ENTIRELY different entities. Just because an employee enters the Apple ""eco-system"" at a base level doesn't mean that the employee may have a better chance of securing a corporate career, even with an adequate curriculum vitae and professional experience. Experiences seem like more of a way to ""tease"" employees rather than show a glimpse of a future career.","Hit or miss. Mainly issues at corporate levels rather than direct store issues. Management styles shouldn't vary wildly manager to manager. Please keep employees up to speed and help them use outside sources to train. ""Hello"" and training modules exist but these tools are useless without ample time to actually study the material. Get some hands on physical basics (computer internals), new phones to practice basic iOS diagnostics/resets. SET ADEQUATE time aside for new hires to learn, I cannot stress this enough. The last thing you need is a new hire sheep waiting for help with a quick fix while management is dealing with unruly customers. It will only benefit in the long run. Some favoritism took place. We all know resources are limited and management at a store level won't change the entire company, but some more measures need to be implemented.

Former Employee ",full-time, more than 5 years,0,"At times it can be fun. You will most likely end up working with some really intelligent and great people. The company strives to build comradery within each retail location and if you happen to be working at a store other than home store, you will find that for the most part, the culture is the same. You really can build some great friendships.","The training is laughable. While the topic is always a source of discussion, the time allotted to learn and study is minimal and is usually plagued with interruptions. Management is top heavy and like any workplace, managers can be ego driven. It's a definite paradox in that the company mandates ""Daily Downloads"". For the most part these are drink the koolaid and cheer leading sessions and you will stand out if you don't participate. Often a lead or a manager will go over what was in a company made video that was distributed to retail locations as a means of motivation. You will soon learn that what is stated in the videos is often not practiced in your store... It can be a toxic and co-dependent nightmare depending on your management team (like any workplace) but at the very the least you will be trying to figure out why there are so many managers per store. The company likes to tell you that Apple retail store are more than retail... The pay structure is often held up to/based on retail pay, but there is a lot to learn and processes and products are constantly changing. You are graded on every single transaction via customer feedback. You will be encouraged and possibly singled out if you do not share enough about yourself with your co-workers and your managers. To summarize, it's hit and miss and more overwhelming instead of engaging. You most likely will not learn as much as you would like to unless you are willing to learn outside of your paid time and the pay, well, you'll probably fall into the category of living pay check to pay check. If you want to really use your mind and have an engaging learning environment I suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, there is ALWAYS a lot of hype about working for Apple and how difficult it is to get a job there and how Cinderella like of a place it is to work at... By the end of your on boarding they will have convinced you that you are part of an elite group. Take it however you want to... One of the big questions I think a lot of people have is if you can get a corporate job if you get hired for a retail position. The answer: yes, but like any other workplace you will need to be a savvy political player.",Listen to and respect your people.,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,3.0,3.0,Doesn't Recommend,,,,,

• No appreciation at all. (not talking about money here. talking about ""thank you"")
• Bad work environment. (too much tension)
• They did not provide a prayer room form me (as I am Muslim) 
• no teamwork - you are not appreciated if you tried to help a member of your team.
• No compensations
• No job growth

I left the job because I did not find myself there and I will never ever EVER work for either ""Apple"" or even ""Apex""",my Advice to both: Apple and Apex is that you need work more on selecting the right people for your HR Dep. and also try to help those who really work hard the site,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

""Indian Managers Will ONLY Hire Other Indians""
1.0
★★★★★
Former Employee ",full-time, more than 8 years,0,"Cutting edge technology, located in the heart of Silicon Valley","If you are not Indian, your days are numbered. Unfair BIAS against non-Indian employees.","The demographics of Apple are shifting, with 95% plus of engineers being of Indian descent. If a company in Silicon Valley were to hire 95% Caucasians, this would be unacceptable, of course. But if an equal percentage of Indians takes over a company, oh well, this makes the company ""Diverse"", right? At Apple, Indian managers have successfully taken over the company (at least in the fields of IT, engineering and computer software). They want to reserve the rich, highly-coveted Silicon Valley Lifestyle for themselves, their relatives, and people of their own Caste who are stuck back at home in Tamil Nadu or some other Southern province. They implicitly believe that native-born Americans are undeserving of this privilege. The Indian managers seek to enforce this policy by upholding a double standard: the bar is very low when they are helping their own to climb the corporate ladder, but the bar raises to an impossibly high level when it comes to native-born American citizens. They see nothing wrong with helping their under-qualified uncles, aunts and cousins to get jobs, while throwing native-born Americans under the bus. If you are not Indian, you don't stand a chance. Apple management has allowed this to happen, they have enabled a system that is extremely discriminatory against Americans, yet they want Americans to purchase their products. But if Apple only wants to hire Indian, then perhaps only Indians should buy their iPhones and iPads, and Americans should think Android instead. If this practice of dismissing extremely qualified and talented American engineers to make room for inferior Indian engineers from specific desired Castes and regions (Tamil Nadu), Apple is going to lose its marketplace lead and engage in a slow (or possibly more rapid) decline. This problem has already gotten way, way out of hand. The time is ripe for corrective action to be taken (either by Apple itself, or if not, then by means of government intervention). NOTHING is diverse about an engineering staff that is 95% South Indian, where access to a job is 100% controlled by a biased, ignorant manager who uses lack of 'skills' and 'fit' as a pretext to weed out employees who have undesirable ethnic backgrounds.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

0,1,0,21 November 2020,06:04:48,Excellent pay and perks but not great culture, Siri Grading Analyst,Hyderābād,,full-time, more than a year,8,"For any position you get awesome salary. Additionally, you get discounts on Apple products upto 17 % for friends and family on every product but you are limited to 10 products of each category(10phones, 10 airpods, 10 macbooks etc). And for your personal use you get 27% but limited to one product of each category. 
You also get 500USD credit additionally for every 2 years. 

You get 15 % discount on stocks but you can just buy them you can only opt to buy shares from your salary and the company will automatically deduct the amount from the salary. It is similar to VPF where you choose the percentage of deduction. Here you can only choose from 0 to 10% of your salary to be invested in shares. You cannot additionally buy elsewhere for 15% discount. 
You can also avail 155000 INR for any educational courses that you need to do. 
During the pandemic they also reimbursed for furniture.","The work culture is good not that interactive. All of the decision making is in Cupertino(HQ) and if you want to contribute to the process then it is not possible. You don't even have someone in the leadership to collaborate with. They give the work and you have to do it, contrary to Amazon where if you propose something and the leadership finds it impactful then they give you the ownership and also collaborate with you on that idea/project. If you want to just work and leave then its great for you but if you want to do something more apart from usual work then the aforementioned applies.

The educational courses mentioned need to be relevant to your work that you are doing at Apple and if your work and the educational course are not in the same field you won't get reimbursed. 
Furniture reimbursement is limited to 100 USD(7000INR) which is quite less. You either get a good table or an ergonomic chair but not both. 

There are not much ad-hoc tasks apart from the daily work which is pretty monotonous and tiring.

For this particular role(grading analyst) they give you iMac and not Macbooks to work so WorkFromHome is not allowed under ideal conditions. Due to the pandemic the iMacs were transported to everyone's homes and WFH was established for the team. 
There is no transport provided by the company but that's manageable since they are paying a lot.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,,,,

Pay is not negotiable and superior sales performance is given little to no consideration during your 'merit increases' which are 3.5-5% per year, once a year. 

The high customer traffic, high noise, bright lights, and being on your feet for 8-9 hours can be physically taxing. Full-time work during holiday and launch season can be draining. The customers in my area were typically high-maintenance types and were often difficult to deal with.

Advancing in the company is more about playing the political game than how well your actual job is being done, which frequently results in people being advanced to management and leadership positions who do not have the right hard skills or competencies for the task.

- Coworkers and peers are incredibly smart","- The Apple culture is changing for worse. What was once a prestigious tech company who had a passion for innovation and people has disappeared and turned into a powerhouse of labor exploitation. Expect long hours and little pay
- On average, Apple provides around 3% pay raises each year. This does not cover the increasing costs of living in Austin. It doesn’t matter how great of an employee you are, you should expect 3%. There is no reason to work hard.
- Apple does not care about the city of Austin or the citizens that live here. Apple takes tax breaks and incentives, while continuing to white-wash any culture out of Austin, contribute to awful traffic patterns, and keeping overall city wages stagnant.
- Utilizing time off benefits is frowned upon. Workload sits for you to complete when you return, negating any kind of ""refreshment"" you feel from being away
- No room for promotions. Management does not care about development or helping you explore other opportunities. 
- Management is constantly talking about how much money our department has saved the company (we’re talking millions of dollars), meanwhile a peer on my team is on food stamps.
- Many of my peers are struggling with mental health issues due to being overworked and not having enough time off. Apple’s health benefits barely cover any type of treatment for mental health issues. Even the “top tier” health insurance plan does not cover widely accepted mental health treatment and instead insurance encourages you to take Xanax.
- When we had on-site doctors, they were low quality and constantly gaslight you",Remember that your employees are humans and many have families. We deserve to be treated better.,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,1,You get a paycheck and you get to work from home,"No managers or support even when customers are screaming at you. Many of my co workers are having mental health issues because of how this job is designed and Apple does not want to hear about it. It is so stressful. I've never worked in a place that I could not get support from a manager. It does not exist in this role. Imagine someone has purchased a $3000 laptop and it never arrived in the mail and they have been given the wrong info when they called before (and the time before that). Yep sorry no you can't speak to a manager because there aren't any and I'm working at home. It's just you and me on the phone and you're yelling at me and there's nothing I can do. For the first few weeks I felt like this was the second worst job I have ever had but now that I've done it for a few months, it's moved into the number one spot. I have nightmares and can’t sleep most nights. I dread sitting at my desk and taking a call because you never know what you’re going to get on the other end of the line. And the whole set up is right in the middle of my home so even when I’m not working, it sits there and I have to look at it.

Former Employee ",full-time, more than a year,1,"Benefits, discounts, health insurance, and a 9-5 job Monday to Friday.","Hypocrisy is the main philosophy of this company. They tell people to not worry and do what they can but they fire a third of the new people before finishing their probation because they are not good enough or they don't bend on their knees enough.
You are even controlled when you pee, how much you pee and they even ask you if you pee day more than the usual one day. You have 7 minutes per day to go to the bathroom and don't you even dare to go if it is a busy day.
The micromanagement in this company is brutal, doesn't matter how much you do, you will be always asked for more, they are always in your back with a whip.
They will try to wash your brain, they will harass you, and prepare yourself to be the manager's ´´favorite´´ if you want to get a higher position. And don't even dare to go to apply to a higher position if you don't want to be depressed as are half of the senior advisors.","Please go to a psychologist, you need it urgently, it is not normal how you treat your employees.",1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

Or it will be someone internal but was transferred from another department. Individual achievements are not recognized. Your success is Apple’s success so know that you are a small cog in a big machine that won’t miss you when you leave. Apple will engulf every aspect of your life.

- Will underpay labor if they can get away with it, especially outside the US","The biggest change that would improve Apple's performance would be to make a much larger effort to let engineers work collaboratively instead of skate around their security guidelines.

Former Employee ",part-time, less than a year,2,"Their training for retail is particularly robust. I didn't find it difficult to go from training to on-the-floor, but it was a 3 day training process. They offer nice discounts and benefits available to those who are seasonal or part-time employees. You will not be able to avail of ALL discounts that Apple offers but there are quite a few you can manage to take advantage from while working there. I think your experience being a product specialist will also heavily rely on when you work at Apple and where. I was hired as a seasonal employee for the winter holidays in Los Angeles. It can be brutal with tourists bombarding you with question after question about discounts you are obviously unable to give them. I found the best people to work with to be the coworkers. They are diverse because Apple wants you to be diverse, which is nice, except that Apple's illusion of caring for diversity pretty much stops once it goes beyond the retail floor.","The kool aid drinking is beyond imaginable. It is cult like. They push real hard the sentiment that Apple is The Best Company in the World to Work For and Look At How Much We Care About Things. I think the company genuinely has more compassion that a few other tech giants but that's not saying much, to be honest. Also some of the store managers have an over-inflated ego about being store managers for an Apple store. But whatever floats their boats I guess.",Please hire more diverse employees in... like... your C-level positions. It doesn't really mean anything when the people running your company are about as spicy as polonaise but you're proud of how diverse your retail employees are. It just means you like to exploit our image.,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,Recommends,Neutral Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

Former Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,1,"You get to see the product road map up to 6-8 years out and it can be fun playing with new technology. You get to make awesome designs for great people.

You will learn a lot. Take advantage of their school reimbursement programs and any skill programs offered.

It will be the highest design standards you will work with in your career. Material, tolerances and finishes must be perfect.

Max our your stock options and when vested 401k.

You will learn cutting edge design methods and have excellent standards and practices.

Overtime is good, this can even go to double time in some cases. Having an extra 2-4 hours of overtime a day adds up. Just make sure to pace yourself and take care of your health.

There is always something to do.

If you love the brand it will draw you in and you will have a role in bringing Apple's products to life.

Your work will have an impact on millions of people.

You will do the work of a higher paid position so it will be nice to get that experience.

If you are doing good use this to get a higher position elsewhere, it will help you advance your career faster.","Management tends to be very self centered, not as much focused on growing your career but in growing their own. This can often cause tension as lots of people are vying for attention of higher ups. Expect to do all manner to tasks to help the team and your manager. Some will be menial but they will lead to more fun and complex projects over time. Make sure you do all your basic work before seeking to get to advanced work. 

There is not a lot of ownership of responsibility in management. Often they will kick downward. For example if they made a call on a design direction and it turns out that the higher ups do not like it they will blame the worker following their request in my experience. Do not count on accountability, however I would recommend if your manager is rude or does something out of line let Apple HR know immediately. It will save you a lot of hassle down the line.

Politics is huge at Apple. Pay very close attention. People will pretend to be your friend or interested in your work to make a connection. If you get too popular with higher ups in a different team management can punish you, even if you were doing your job. Have a pulse on politics. Rank is big at Apple.

Apple's biggest flaw is they rush themselves to the breaking point where for no reason. Often cutting already tight timelines for small reasons rather than give someone an additional 8 hours to refine a design. They can set the deadlines and standards but they often push people far beyond reasonable limits and in some cases the deadlines can be changed just as easily as they are set. In some cases I have worked 28 hours straight on a prototype that could just have easily been move out one day. This creates a scramble culture where you will be under a lot of stress often. You will be blamed for not doing work fast enough when often you can be given timelines that are not physically possible. In those cases be prepared to set expectations so you will not be taken advantage of.

The average day is 12 hours. During a build it typically goes until the project is done. This mind you will get you a 'meets expectations' on your review. Doing above average work is average for Apple standards. You need to go above even that or have a good political connection for the next level.

Often you will have to leave the company/position you are in to get a promotion of any value. Its such a waste that Apple does not help grow people's careers especially after investing so much time into them.

You will often be asked to do the work of others and get no credit for it, even if you do your own expiration be careful as your manager may take your idea. Document everything you do, this will help.

You will often be pushed to commit everything to work and be accessed at all hours of the day. Be careful in how you set boundaries as this can often lead to you not being seen as serious.

You will often do the work at a higher level than your current position but not be paid more for it. You will often help people make extremely complicated projects and get no real recognition for it.","Recognize ambition and try not to make the career development of others about advancing your own career. Help build others up rather than try and take credit for the work of others.

Listen when people tell you something is wrong or if the person you manage is being bullied. Seriously, listen and help.

When you say you will push back and help with insanely tight deadlines, actually do it. I cannot say how many time we would have a meeting where we would all say the timeline is impossible, our manager would say ""Yep I'll bring that up when we meet,"" then we all met and they would not say a word when the designer laid out their expectations and timeline.",3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Recommends,Neutral Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than 8 years,1,"Great pay, benefits for LGBT families including healthcare","Constantly shifting management, difficult to advance,","At home advisors are micro-managed on so many different numbers. Your manager will constantly tell you there is something you can improve on. I've found that you can work for this company for a decade and still be stuck doing the same tasks in the same position. 

There will be peers you meet that moved up quickly and management will tell you it’s your fault if you haven’t transitioned into a higher role. You will have the same manager for about 6 months max, then they will take a leave of absence or go to a new department- so you’re stuck proving yourself to someone new. 

If you are chat support, they will expect you to help up to 3 individuals at once (4 if you are consulting with another department) and respond within 2 minutes while customers are asking “Hello, are you there?” and you are told to lie if the customer asks if we’re helping multiple people.

If you are not fast enough, they will question your ability and recommend you get medical help. Completely absurd.

Repair pricing for all devices is expensive for the average person. This truly is a luxury brand and you will find out soon enough when customers cannot afford the ridiculous prices this company wants to charge everyone for out of warranty repairs.

Bonuses are never received, but there are annual performance reviews typically followed by a 40 cent pay raise and heavily taxed Restricted Stock Units that you cannot touch for years. You will make good money working here, but you will be expected to devote all your time to helping customers in an extremely stressful, fast paced environment while staring at white space on a screen all day.

The major takeaway working for Apple- is that you’re working for a huge corporate conglomerate that overcharges for everything, and furthers capitalism in a way that has made humans codependent on our screens and immediate gratification.",2.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

However much of this is due to the large size of the company and court rulings that favor poor performing employees because ""Apple is so big is can take the hit when an employee calls out repeatedly"" however what they fail to realize is that when 20% of the staff is calling out repeatedly, it impacts the customer experience and makes managing attendance a nightmare. Additionally, there is very little growth that has been occurring at Apple for the last 3-4 for years.

- Worked in a very talented collaborative team, can't emphasise this enough!
- Plenty of opportunity to level-up communication skills internally and with customers particularly in a flagship store
- Working in dynamic situations under competing pressures means similar situations in other contexts are a doddle now
- Attention to detail and people centred approach (to customer service & technology) Have not found this at other companies","- HUGE disconnect between marketing and reality particularly in regards to diversity and inclusion. Sadly there's no real commitment to seriously support and celebrate all employees, address genuine disparities or to listen and act on feedback in this regard whether on a store level or Cupertino.
-Management: lack knowledge and competencies across all areas of store including in customer conflict deescalation and resolution, some have bullying/gate-keeperish line management style, make decisions without input of people on the ground, physical and mental wellbeing of staff is not a priority.
- Cult like company culture leads to inability to publicly express a range of thoughts and emotions even outside of work
- high turnover particularly of shop floor colleagues particularly at Xmas
- Poor life/work balance due to scheduling
- No real opportunities exist connecting corporate to retail arm
- Pay is extremely low for what you actually do
- Upwards progression non existent due to favouritism and bias
- Made to feel very disposable and exploited
- Told Metrics/KPIs are not so important when you join but you soon realise they are seen as most important thing - even above customer experience
- Genius Bar 'Resets' are supposed to be a short well-deserved rest but instead become the primary way training is delivered","You will haemorrhage talent if you do not invest in development and progression, whilst compensating and recognising your team's passion and craft.

Former Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,1,"Good benefits
Good parking
Decent Caffe if you don’t work 2nd or 3rd shift.","Management doesn’t attend to employee needs for working internal tools

You work every holiday

Managers are basically astrologers that guess metrics and that’s it. 

No useful coaching towards the unreasonable goals and expectations 

Not given enough time to do the job.

Awful schedules that change every 3 months. Good luck having consistent events with friends! 

The customers are extremely harsh and the ability to meet their demands for service is impossible.","The vender sites are the worst thing to happen to the companies support structure. Which vendors make up the vast majority of of the current support staff. They’re under trained and under paid. 

Working holidays is ridiculous when closures are customary. 

Management needs to be more accountable for ensuring advisors have resources and procedures along with understanding them. 

Procedural questions require answers. Not having someone capable of answering many different internal procedural questions looks like sloppy hiring. 

Hiring external managers that have never performed the role and expecting them to succeed is a recipe for failure.",1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,3.0,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,

Former Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,1,"- (subjective) As each of the 'most desireable' FANG companies has their own culture, Apple has theirs. Its a bit more low-key, professional and relaxed.
- after the initial shock of ""I work at Apple now"" fades away, work is work and your satisfaction/stress level will vary depending on your role, department, skill set and organization. I transferred between 3 different organizations - some very political, others like family. Sometimes within an org, 1 managers style (understanding, laid back - just expects quality work on time etc) would be a complete opposite of my coworkers under another manager (9-5 run like an agency)
- if you're ambitious there is opportunity - but also know there is a sautés quo and you are taking a risk. its up to you whether or not its worth it.
- looks great on your resume","Alot of politics, I've seen entire agencies brought in for single projects where the end result was scraped. I've seen managers hire relatives and Apple outsources their 'investigations' department who get paid by how many people they accuse of violating policies.","Not to all management, but to those who contract security teams and to whoever made the decision that your personal iCloud account becomes you work account. you find this out during orientation but by then its too late to create a new Apple ID.

There's no opportunity for separation of ""church and state"" and as I experienced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy was enacted, there was no announcement and I was interrogated for violating it after being an above average (based on performance reviews) employee for ~4 years.",3.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,3.0,3.0,Neutral Outlook,,,,,
