The medical benefits are provided and quite comprehensive. The staff can also use the university facilities, such as library, swimming pool, canteen etc. The staff can leave the office sharp as the working hour is regular.","It is only suitable for people who look for routine and boring job and it is good for wasting your time. The workload is sometimes massive but learn nothing at all.

Some colleagues work very stupid and use the most stubborn way to work on a very simple piece of work. The culture in the company has already been default and no one would try to change it or no one would accept changes. It takes super long time and hierarchy to process a new idea. They are afraid to make mistakes so no one would improve. You must stick to the stupid rules if you want to survive here.

For the management, most of them have worked in this university for over 10 years so they feel like only they have the right to say and do not listen to the subordinates' opinions and just instruct the juniors with their own ideas only. Usually they have nothing to do and just order the juniors to do their work and push all the blames on the junior.

If you still have hope and passion to your life, do not waste a single minute here. It is the worst organization I have ever worked.",Try to appreciate the work of juniors and provide constructive training to them. Don't waste their talent and life because of your selfishness.,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,1.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,No Opinion of CEO,,,
