In my time since work at AME (approx 5yrs ago) I have gone on to work in other commoditiy based business and EVERY person I have ever spoken about having worked at AME either A) laughed and we shared stories about the time they worked there to or B) they expressed genuine disbelief at how poor the work from AME is

I laugh now whenever I see material from AME in my day to day. Many times I have actively recommended businesses I am associated with NOT to use AME simply due to its exceptionally poor standard of work.

It is amazing to me the company still has clients. The level of useful, insightful analysis behind the work is shockingly low and out of date. The number of times embarrassing errors were pointed out by clients was endless.","Read these review. Take it on board. Maybe aim for some self improvement.

Former Employee ",full-time, less than a year,6,"AME is a well-trodden path from the technical world into financial services. Many have used it as a short stepping stone and done well. A larger number have slipped and died professionally whilst trying.

Depending on the role, some people get the opportunity to meet a lot of people in the industry. It’s a very steep learning curve and some of the on-the-job training for juniors is excellent, albeit self directed.

The company is always hiring. It’s not growing, you’re just being interviewed to replace the last person who was pushed out or got fed up and resigned.","There’s a reason it’s only a stepping stone. It’s a hell hole of a place to work. About 50% of staff don’t make it through the first twelve months either failing probation or being made ‘redundant’. You should only ever accept a position with AME if you are not working and consider it a short term stint whilst you look for something else.

They pay is lousy for what is expected and the work hours are long. Contractual hours are 830am to 6pm with an hour for lunch, or 42.5 hours per week. However leaving at 6pm is frowned upon. One well-known but unwritten KPI is the time you leave. In reality, junior staff should expect to work a 45-50 hour week, and more senior staff 50-55 hours per week. Every week. A call with a client in London can mean you won’t get out of the office until 9pm. There’s no time in lieu, it’s back to the office at 830 the next morning. AME is particularly difficult for people with family commitments.

The horrendous staff turnover saps efficiency and contributes to the longer hours. Efficiency and quality is reduced by forever training new people to do the same thing. For those staff that do manage to hold on to their job, the job satisfaction is low as you can never break free of the tedium. It’s also demoralising watching your friends and colleagues be bullied and sacked one after the other.

The most vile part of AME is the toxic, back-stabbing culture that stems from the owner. He cannot relate to people and has big problems with trust. He can’t be trusted and he trusts no-one. It’s a vicious cycle. He’s convinced that every member of staff is inherently lazy and will do nothing given the opportunity. Every control system (e.g. internal office CCTV, email monitoring, keystroke logging, work hour recording) plays into this his obsession that staff are stealing (time). All decisions and expenses however small go across his desk.

At the same time, staff don’t trust management, and rightfully so given the frequent lies and u-turns. There is no honesty between staff and management. Anyone who objects to the company direction-du-jour will just end up being the next person in line to be bullied until they resign or be ‘retrenched’. Being too committed to one direction might find you favour temporarily, but once the wind changes you’re exposed.

Management is utterly ineffective and concentrated with the owner. Formal management structures have been dissolved and change on a whim. All are designed to play staff off against one another and feed information on supposed individual staff underperformance back to the owner.","If you don’t want Glass Door sit at the top of the Google results when someone searches for AME, stop placing fake reviews. The more often a page is updated, the higher in the search results it is placed by the search engine algorithms. The bland and unrealistic positive reviews invite more comments from staff who would otherwise be silent.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,,,,

The atmosphere still sounds toxic.

The culture of the organization is still riven with problems caused by Shaun.

The quality of the work still sounds like it is very materially compromised by the extraordinarily high staff turnover, the lack of development and a leadership team that have absolutely no idea about the mining industry. 

Indeed I was often put in a position of either having to lie to clients about what work had been done, or having to profusely apologize for the substandard quality of the work, all while “the leadership” actually hid (and I mean actually physically hid). 

My time at AME was an eye opening experience, to see how an organisation should not be run and to work for someone I believe to be a genuinely unpleasant individual.

Former Employee ",full-time, more than a year,55,I got to write the cons on Glassdoor when I left. These reviews are smuggled into the office like western media into North Korea. These reviews give the poor souls still trapped there hope for the future. Plus they are also good for a laugh on Friday when you get beer. Oh look. A single. Realistic. Pro.,"This website has said a great deal about AME. I don’t see any point in repeating what has already been said by past employees. It clearly doesn’t stop people from entering through the door for an interview. Therefore, the aim of this review is to stop people from even bothering to apply for anything posted by this company.

The worst thing about this company is not the physically demanding hours and pathetic excuse for a wage (although these two reasons are pretty bad). No, the worst thing about this company is how it will change you psychologically. It will warp you. It will corrupt you. The perverse nature of simply existing within these walls will destroy you. And the worst part is you won’t even notice it. Not until you tell friends. You’ll even joke about. You’ll say something like…

“Someone else got fired today. It’s the third one this month. And they’ve only been here for two days! Then gone, poof. I didn’t even bother remembering their name. I don’t bother remembering anyone’s name unless they’ve been here for over a month”. Then you’ll probably laugh. HAHAHAHAHA.

Your friends will be shocked. They’ll probably say something like. “I can’t believe such a terrible place exists. You have to leave”. And you’ll just shrug it off. Maybe you’ll blame the terrible job market. Or maybe you'll point out the fact that rent doesn’t pay itself. However, it doesn’t change the fact you laughed.

Think about it. You laughed, you mocked someone in the exact same situation as you. They also exist in a terrible job market and I bet they have to pay rent too. You saw someone in the same terrible situation as you and you joked and laughed at their misery. 

Aren’t you also miserable? Of course you are. You work at AME. Why are you laughing at someone in the exact same situation as you? Would you laugh a homeless person on the street? Or someone lying on a hospital bed? I know the laughter is ironic. It is the cynical snickering that comes from black humour. Everyone here shares the same fate. United in adversity, as you will read in all the other reviews. But ask yourself. Right now. As someone who has not been tainted by AME. Would you laugh if someone else got fired for doing nothing wrong in their first few days? If you’re already at AME, it is too late. But hey, at least there’s beer on Friday right? 

And this is why AME is so terrible. It is so cancerous that it strips you of basic human compassion. If you work here you will no longer be able to look at people as if they were actually people. New people are just sacrifices, a fresh batch of souls cooking in the oven for the CEO. Working here will remove something that is basically ingrained into you at birth because you cannot believe something so perversely inhumane (the CEO) has the audacity to assume the form of a normal functioning human being.

Beware the wolf in sheep’s clothing. If he’s charming to you in the interview (if you even get what could pass off as an interview), press the Glassdoor button. He will be so flustered you’ll think English is his second language. He might even get out some paper and draw a lot of diagrams to prove god knows what.","How to Make a Painkiller (Cocktail)

Former Employee ",full-time,,33,Your colleagues are generally decent and united in the shared disrespect of Shaun Brown.,"The problems with AME lie directly with the owner, Shaun Browne. At best, his management is comically awful with compulsive decision making, value-destroying about-turns and a child-like understanding of the technical aspects of the mining and oil and gas industries. At worst, Shaun Browne is a chronic bully - mentally, verbally and physical. He appears to contrive tension by pitting staff against each other. Senseless personnel changes are ongoing and poorly communicated. You could suddenly be reporting to someone else or, unbeknownst to you, people reporting to you could suddenly be reporting to a different colleague. 
Shaun Browne has a Trump-like ego and is blithely unaware of his own ineptitude. He has owned this business for over 25 years and literally knows nothing else outside those four walls. It is painfully obvious to even the youngest of analysts who have worked in professionally-run organisations that he is quite clueless. Unfortunately this makes Shaun Browne quite condescending and will constantly remind the staff that he has ""being doing this longer than anyone else"" and considers that justification for his poor decision making.
If you’re going for a BD role, do not expect to last for longer than 6 months. Otherwise, if you show any initiative you will be exploited mercilessly and dumped after a couple of years.

The only thing worse than working at AME is knowing that AME can pay third party companies, or even Glassdoor itself to remove some of the negative posts and place higher weighting to positive comments, that have been clearly written by the owner or his immediate family. I have previously been tasked with signing up to 'Internet Reputation' companies that we pay to try to improve our image on Glassdoor.

If you are applying for a Business Development or Human Resources position, don't bother! I my 2 years here I have not seen anyone last more than 4 months, most last only a week or so.

Turnover here is huge, circa 60-70% per year. The people that stay (myself included) are either brainwashed, have limited opportunities elsewhere due to the market, or are just starting out and need to prove themselves.

There are no perks, the owner of the company tries to be charming but once you're there he will dictate every aspect of your employment down to the colour short you wear, where you will sit (which changes weekly), and he even tries to interfere with people's personal lives. To say the owner is a micromanager is the understatement of the year.

Nightmares will become commonplace. Long hours are expected. You will be given 10 times the amount of work that would normally be expected. Your job title will change monthly and if you are good at your job, he will pile more and more work on that person until they break. It is heartbreaking to see because these are some of the best people I have ever worked with. Without the owners constant interfering and crazy behaviour, this company could go places. Unfortunately the company remains stagnant, always trying to replace lost staff, instead of focussing on what it's good at.

- Camaraderie is strong in the face of adversity
- If you have a tough skin and know how to lick managerial boots, you will likely succeed here
- When the boss is overseas, the environment improves immensely and you may do your job well
- If you're starting out on the path of your career, this is a good stepping stone—so long as you only stay here as long as is respectable with regards to your resume
- Some positions allow you to clock off at your contracted time and leave your work at work (although, most expect overtime on an almost daily basis)
- If you do your job well and help others wherever possible, you will likely make firm friends through respect and trust","- The boss doesn't know where the company is going (or if he does know where he wants it to go, he can't make up his mind how to get there, so be prepared to work your fingers off on a whim of his, to then have all that work disregarded the next week, to then be forced to focus on something else)
- You will get intimidated by the boss on a daily basis, whether he's in the office or overseas
- High turnover rate of staff, due to dissatisfaction with the work environment, intimidation, stress and lack of respect shown by upper management, which means you will likely have to make friends quickly, and see them leave soon after
- Quantity is valued over quality, so don't expect to do your best work here
- Staff members are overworked and not remunerated for extra efforts or overtime
- Culture of backstabbing and mistrust is rampant
- Family-run business, so the boss thinks he's a king and you are his servants
- Do not expect your suggestions to be taken seriously—you are there to carry out orders, no matter how illogical they may be
- The boss will charm you into thinking he values your opinions, but he doesn't, he simply wants to deceive you about his true character—but you will learn in time and through experience
- If you are considering work experience here as part of a degree, be prepared for a hard slog—you will be treated terribly, the system will not be explained to you in full and you will likely walk away from the experience with a warped view of the industry
- Do not take a job here unless you have no other choice

Any rating over two stars for this company and its boss are likely written by management. Do not trust any reviews that claim the environment is stimulating and creative or that you have opportunities to grow in this company. You do not, unless you have the same manipulative personality as its owner. Work outside of your contract will be thrust upon you but you will not thrive or be rewarded for extra duties.

This is not a 'disgruntled' ex-worker's review. This is an honest review, with a mind to warn anyone who may be considering a position here. Weigh up your options very carefully.","- Management would do well to respect those who have come to work for them and to not treat them like 'things' that they own.

81,0,0,0,13 March 2016,21:37:05,Fast-paced and competitive, Research Manager,Sydney,,full-time, more than a year,5,"AME has a highly competitive outfit; with lean business units in all cities it has office. It is flexible and fast-paced, constantly re-structuring and modernizing. 
Executive management sets the strategy (milestones and targets) to each research manager. These carry precise expectations regarding schedule and budget. At the same time there is great autonomy on how to conduct the research.
Typically research teams will have young engineers supporting senior consultants with lots of field experience. So work provides many opportunities to meet experts in the field, but is also lively and full of young ambitious people. Friday beers are almost like a religion.
Working hours are normal. But the environment extremely fast-paced and targets are always set to challenge the team. Improving productivity, quality and developing new products dominate management agenda since I joined. Ruthless pursuit for improvement that can be contagious, especially because management is fast in identifying and promoting good workers/ideas. But if you are not a competitive self-motivated person, this might not be the place for you. I have seen plenty of turnovers related to this mentality.
If you are highly driven, the learning curves are astonishing. Even though each team deals with training in their own way, engineering and economic experience abound. There is always an area of expertise new employees don’t have experience with, be it the economic valuation / marketing strategy, or the technical engineering side of natural resource projects.","AME is a family-owned business, this means decision making is fast and responsive but also very concentrated on the Executive Director. 
Part of IT is outsourced which is not ideal. 
For field engineers going into research, pay is not ideal.
They have coffee but it is terrible, bring your own.","Improved transparency on individual business units financial results. Making staff minority partners could improve pay, motivation and retention.",4.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,2.0,4.0,Recommends,Neutral Outlook,Approves of CEO,"September 13, 2017",CTO,

COVID-19",09:05:16,"Diversity is Lip Service, Amazing Peers just terrible Mgmt", Senior Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",,full-time, more than 3 years,13,"Friendly cohorts/peers and cool network of amazing people after you head out, good company events (when there isn't covid) and opportunities to travel, sign-on benefits are really nice.","Leadership - from top to bottom. Actually listen to your ERG groups, they are the best part and the backbone of your company. Listen to your good managers and stop keeping the rotten ones.","I was at Github a while back, several months ago. I wanted to give it a minute so I could write a level-headed review. Now I'm at a another company and chilled out and reflective about my experience. 

I'm going to start with my criticism of the ERG groups (Octogatos, Blacktocats, and Octoqeers) because I think it's both Github's biggest strength and downfall. They have great people there that they completely underutilize and continue to lose.

While I did see a lot of growth and opportunity during my years at the company, as well as women in positions of leadership -- overall Github's efforts for diversity and inclusion are largely lip service and anecdotal - as some of those same women in leadership unfortunately contribute to the problem all the same as the men. A layoff last year included mostly women (and more specifically BIPOC women) which was whispered through the company and handled TERRIBLY. I also saw several woman (incl women of color, as well as lgbt women incl myself) leave my own team within my short time there. As a matter of fact, my sr manager only hired former employees from the same regional company s/he had previously worked for. For this position, they had the opportunity to interview (frankly over)qualified men and women color for a sr engineering position which took quite literally over a dozen hours to interview for, only to have an engineer GIVEN to us from sr leadership...because somebody knew him from our Parent company -- I never even interviewed him for the position. What the hell was the point of 12 hours of interviews and lengthy greenhouse submissions, then?

Overall turnover and burnout rate continues to be an issue as people were hired and left shortly thereater, from what I could see, an average of a year. Nepotism in management runs very deep. Escalations to leadership are unheard and empty, as on more than one occasion Ive heard of employees (incl myself) being written up for speaking out for feeling uncomfortable. If you want to know about the company's history of performative bullcrap, look no further than when they signed a contract with ICE only to have a wave of internal employee complaints including a TOWN HALL where the head of legal spoke out against our CEO. This also spread on twitter, news media outlets, and the internal employee petition that was signed by many people (myself included) which you can still find as a pull request if you're working there. Services like the Octogatos and Blacktocats are great and a wonderful start to reel people in but ultimately the buck stops at senior leadership who seem to believe in employee empowerment & open door policies at a surface level only. This does not diminish the work of the wonderful people overseeing and contributing to these employee initiatives and is indicative only of the program management that stifles their efforts. This goes from individual team leadership all the way up to HR and the executive board. 

This is all contrary to the supposed work-life balance and unlimited PTO the remote infrastructure would indicate. Much like other elite tech companies, Github suffers the Silicon Valley-esque allure wherein they'll convince you that you're a chosen Golden Child for being blessed for the opportunity to be working for them. Imposter Syndrome is talked about often, even for new hires, but then when you actually do your 1:1s or skip level and want to give open door policy feedback about/to your manager - you can quite literally retaliated against. That isn't to say that Github doesn't have wonderful managers among the lot, just that they are trapped in an unfortunately nepotistic system that is def present from the top, down. After spending a few years there I'm actually more convinced that these lectures about Imposter Syndrome during new hire orientation were actually meant to beat you down/convince you that you shouldn't work there, so that you feel bad for speaking up. ""We all feel it! Don't worry! Just talk to your manager if you're having problems with xyz because we'll be here for you."" It's baloney. In my own direct experience (as well as others, the network of people who have left the company is large and we do talk), that...is definitely the case. 

The benefits package is nice but leaves a lot to be desired when work hours aren't respected. Maternity leave for mothers is great until mothers are still pressured or feel bothered by upper management to do daily check ins. ""COVID flex time"" as I'll call it based on the company memo that was sent out, is given as lip service but when someone in your family is effected by the pandemic - suicide, healthcare workers, general anhedonia and new severe depression diagnosis are a few I heard -- there is virtually no sympathy given and project deadlines are all that matter. The best parts all come when you onboard, which is nice. The telecommunications stipend, home office setup, and offer to buy back the laptop were all nice. 

Lack of clarity and constant restructuring of departments are par the course and expected. If you're a new hire now, I would quite literally expect that you have a new manager and quite possibly new team by the end of the year due to high turnover. This is every team, though I saw it especially often on cloud services, security, and legal. 

Overall it seems like my experience at Github is pretty typical. You'll find some really awesome peers, coworkers, and management really trying to do the right thing. But overall everyone gets fed up with the entrenched nepotism and lack of oversight (as well as frequent unheard employee complaints) eventually. *shrugs*",2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,17,"The ability to work remotely, unlimited vacation, good pay, excellent healthcare benefits, 401K matching, learning and development stipend. I work in a fantastic team with kind, hard-working and easy-going people. Since I am a remote employee, I log in every day thinking about how lucky I am to have joined such a great company where people treat me with respect and where I do not have to commute. Sure, there are times when there's confusion, not clear direction and ambiguity, or other times when the company has sold their product to companies or to government agencies that seem to oppose company values, but this happens in all companies. In spite of those things, which I consider a few bumps in the road, I find that the company has an amazing culture and that they spend a lot of effort in trying to keep the culture open, friendly, respectful and inclusive. Sure, things have changed, and maybe 2 years ago, the culture was better than now, but even so, this is much better than so many other companies that have strict hierarchies, bully and toxic cutures, or that give you barely 10 days of time off. I feel happy and valued at GitHub and it has improved my quality of life ten-fold from my previous job. I feel that many people at GitHub do not realize how good it is at GitHub and they focus on the few negative areas that can be improved, and do not realize that other companies are so much worse. My personal experience has been great and all in all it's one of the best companies to work for, and I have already been lucky to work for 2 other amazing companies.","I am very concerned that this is too good to stay this way, and my biggest concern is about the GitHub acquisition. Other cons are that there is ambiguity and constant change. Also, lately we have more restrictions about much we can spend on the phones we use for work or laptops get now replaced less often. This makes me feel that will be even tighter once we are under Microsoft.","Improve communication. Sometimes, several months go by before we have a company all-hands meeting.

They do place a significant amount of trust on each employee to do what is right for the company, the customer and the values that we have to uphold. In saying this, if you are a self-motivated individual, you should find that GitHub is a place where you can truly thrive!

1. Remote Work. Don't come in with preconceived notions. This is the real deal. You have the autonomy to pretty much create your own workflow. So don't feel guilty about that 30 minute nap after lunch on a Wednesday!

2. Benefits. The benefits rock. Especially the T&E. Nope I'm not gonna be the one to spill the beans but you will be well satisfied upon receiving your benefits package!

Sense of Entitlement. I do feel that some workers internally have a sense of entitlement type of feeling. As such, being as GitHub has generally been a company that empowers its workers, anytime something is changed to safeguard the company as a whole, or if something is implemented that doesn't go with someone's exact suggestion, people can get a bit touchy feely about it. (Hence some of the earlier reviews I imagine). The grass is NOT always greener on the other side.

2. Onboarding. I loved onboarding. But it is quite confusing. This is always going to be a challenge with a company that focuses on being distributed like we are.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,44,Remote friendly work culture. A very expensive SF office space to work in for those who work in SF.,"There is no leadership to speak of. From the Executives to middle management there is no experience and no direction. GitHub went from a ""no managers"" environment to promoting managers from within who lack management experience and training. This has led to a highly political, cliquey culture that favors ""friends"" and punishes those ""outside of the circle"".

Chris Wanstrath's commitment to ""Diversity & Exclusion"" has led to hiring practices where managers say, ""we're not hiring any more white males"" or ""we're not hiring that transgender person because they used to be a white male"" or yet, ""we're not interested in that black man. We really want to hire a woman for this role"". All true statements personally heard. It has gotten to the point of reviewing the candidates Linkedin profile photo to see if they are a ""good fit"" for an interview. Wrong race? Wrong gender? Cancel the interview.

There is no accountability and no ramifications to any of these actions. It's widely accepted and expected. This practice is so well known and runs so deep that very manager and director is complacent in this practice.

Interview feedback is routinely deleted if it's not favorable for a ""diversity hire"". Didn't pass the technical interview? We'll delete that and give you an easier one so that a sub-par engineer can be hired. This has lead to the rapid decline of the engineering talent.","Now that Microsoft has announced the deal to acquire GitHub they need to come in and clean house.

Former Employee ",full-time,,41,"GitHub is full of extremely talented, sharp, and generally emotionally intelligent people who work on a product that people love and is nearly essential to any software developer. They work in an environment that is very remote-friendly as well as accommodating to SF-based employees, with a boatload of exceptional perks and thoughtfulness toward a solid work-life balance.

Plus, when you leave - either by your own decision or through their now well-known layoff cycles - you'll have a brand name worth its weight in gold on your resume.","No matter how good of an environment GitHub creates, nobody actually does their best work there. This is due to a culture that rewards politics and favoritism over merit and cultural contributions to the organization.

There's a reason why GitHub alumni do great things once they leave the company. GitHubbers are becoming CEOs, Heads of Product, and leaders at other successful companies - it's surprising that GitHub simply considered them expendable.

In addition, GitHub does not seem to understand how to reward and retain good employees, and it makes dubious decisions on staffing. You could be producing exceptional work one day but find yourself on a Performance Improvement Plan - or, even worse, shown the door and locked out of your accounts - the next. 

All of this boils down to an executive and management team that wildly varies in its ability to lead. Some have years of solid experience with just a few areas of growth needed; others are completely in over their heads and are given no true compass to follow, causing their departments to suffer. And since GitHub hasn't invested in a solid leadership development or career growth program - something it should have at 10 years of age and 700+ employees - it's not a place that I would advise anyone go to in order to take a positive step in their career.","Find a suitable buyer, sell the company, and bring in seasoned leadership to help GitHub reach its true potential as a developer resource.",2.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time,,24,"GitHub is a fantastic place to work. 

The people are what make it. While I've been at GitHub, I've had incredible conversations about how to be a better person, how to encourage more women to enter tech, and how to make the open source community a better place. All of these conversations have so far been informal and outside of GitHub's larger strategies for social impact. I'm just happy to work among such thoughtful people. 

It's been great to get to know my coworkers even though I'm working remotely. It's hard sometimes, but I feel like GitHub gives remote employees many opportunities to meet each other and feel like they're still part of the team. If I start feeling weird or excluded, I can express that and something will change to make me feel more included. I also know I can take a trip to San Francisco and work with my team for a week or two. 

Finally, it doesn't hurt that the benefits are insane. There are a few I haven't even taken advantage of, yet, because they seem so extravagant. I feel taken care of to say the least.","There is some tension as the company grows and changes. People who've been working at GitHub for a while seem to sense that it is losing something—it's open culture, maybe. I think there are people who are actively fighting against this loss, and overall it is heading in the right direction. It does cause some awkwardness, though, and I do hope we can maintain what people feel was so special.

As I said, working remotely is tough. Sometimes I feel like I would be better at my job if I worked at HQ, just for the exposure to serendipitous interactions and the ability to yell across the room at my coworkers.","Encourage and maintain communication. In fact, over-communicate whenever possible.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,23,"The best part about working at GitHub is the great colleagues! They are uniformly friendly, super talented, and have a positive, supportive attitude. All the engineers I have worked with have been really motivated and produce high-quality work.

A majority of GitHub employees work remotely; some in small satellite offices but most at home/cafes/shared office space/whatever. Because of this, the company goes to a lot of effort to make remote work effective. Communications are largely asynchronous (e.g., via GitHub issues and pull requests), most meetings are streamed and recorded, and there are lots of chances to meet other GitHubbers when necessary: the annual company summit, mini-summits for departments or teams kicking off a project, plus we are welcome to travel to visit HQ or other GitHubbers when we feel the urge to connect. Most ""synchronous"" discussion takes place in online chat, though even here transcripts are kept for anybody to read. Time zones can be a real hassle but otherwise it all works quite well. It's so awesome being able to work for a San Francisco-based company while being able to live almost anywhere!

The company is very transparent. Many company-wide issues are discussed in the open, and anybody's input is welcome.

Until the beginning of 2014, GitHub didn't have any formal management structure to speak of. The result was predictable: people worked on what they found exciting, but it was hard to gather critical mass to implement large-scale projects. Since then people-managers have been introduced, which has improved the company focus. So far management has used a relatively light touch. In particular, work is still mostly organized by the engineers working on it rather than top-down by management. In my opinion the introduction of management has improved the company, though it has definitely caused a shift in the culture.

GitHub the company also seems to have a good heart. As far as I can tell, everybody at the company from top to bottom is really trying hard to do the right thing:

* There is a constant internal dialog about how to improve diversity, both within GitHub (e.g., by doing everything we can to eliminate bias in our recruiting processes) and also within the whole industry (for example by supporting organizations and events that are targeted at underrepresented groups). This isn't just an HR goal; we are all thinking about it.
* We do everything we can to support open-source software. Most obviously, we provide free Git hosting to open-source projects, and we give our free users every bit the same level of support as we give to our paying customers. We contribute internally-developed code to upstream open-source projects as much as possible. We have ""open-source Fridays"" twice a month when GitHubbers are encouraged to work on open source projects. We sponsor many open-source conferences and other events.
* GitHub promotes a healthy work-life balance. I guess (being alpha-geeks) a lot of us work too many hours. But that pressure doesn't come from the company. I've never seen anything but encouragement for people announcing vacation (which is unlimited) or taking parental leave (4 months PTO for new parents).

Finally, it's great to build a product that millions of people use and love. It's a pleasure to run into GitHub users in real life because they are so positive about the company. We're helping to propagate the open-source ethos:

* We provide a great place for open-source projects to host their code.
* Companies use GitHub to promote code-sharing and communal development internally, and often to open-source internal projects.
* There are even governments that put draft legislation in GitHub and allow citizens to propose pull requests to change it.

Reading back over what I've written, it sounds like I'm a marketing shill. But in fact I'm just a very happy software engineer. After nearly two years at the company I am still almost giddy that I get to work at GitHub.","Remote work impedes serendipitous communication. It's an effort to keep up with what is happening in the rest of the company when you don't bump into your colleagues in the kitchen or in the elevator.

As a hangover from the management-free days, it can sometimes still be hard to figure out who is in charge of what.","With employees the caliber of GitHub's, a little management goes a long way. Be careful not to allow management to grow into a separate caste. Especially, don't let it evolve into a dynamic where edicts flow down and no information/feedback flows up. (So far it's not a problem, but it is a risk.)",5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, less than a year,12,"It's hard to tell what working at GitHub would be like from simply reviewing external sources. We don't have much of a presence outside of the walls we work in when it comes to Glassdoor, Linkedin and other sites that potential employees do the usual poking around in before they apply. I was cautious to throw my name into the hat for these very reasons. 

Each article I pulled up was outdated and a lot of the information I was able to obtain was from unreliable sources, or went against everything that I felt could be true after talking with the team and meeting them in person. Was GitHub just really good at making me think they were an awesome company, or were they really as awesome as they seemed to be, but never cared to tell people about it? 

After joining the team (one of the best decisions I have made in my career), I can now tell you with confidence that it is because word simply never got out about just how great being a GitHubber truly is. 

- Work with people who still have passion. With the flexible hours and unlimited vacation, I was finally able to join a team that not only worked hard, but had yet to be completely burned out. 
- Put your family first. GitHub gets it. We all have lived outside of work and they understand that these lives take precedent over something 9-5. They offer maternity and paternity leave, which I was thrilled to hear about. 
- Dogs at work. If you have a dog, this is heaven. If you don't, even better. You can play with someone else's and then say goodbye when you leave for home. 
- Flexibility with what you do and how you do it. Take on those additional projects and offer your extra time to different teams. They encourage cross team training and the company is small enough to make it a reality. 
- Remote but united. A lot of the company works remote, but with team summits and the companies annual summit, you get plenty of face time with the people you work with. 
- My rant could go on forever, but trust me, there are so many more pros to working here.","- Not a ton of information on all of the great diversity initiatives this company is taking on, but I am sure that will change in the following months.

- There is no clear target.
- There is no regular team meeting so staffs don't know how their procrastinations affect the others.

The corridor of the science labs is extremely narrow. Workplace toxicity is rampant, with unfortunately a lot of it comes from the professors themselves, and some colleagues can be very conservative. There are also cases when research ideas can be scooped with few people caring about research ethics. Backstabbing is a common practice there.

No one really cares how well you work or whether you work enough or not- it's a matter of showing up to work and staying through the years.
Working as a team of doctors makes the risk shared when compared with individual practice.
Small groups of individuals work amazingly few productive hours per week on this decent pay.
Still provides amazing subsidized medical service considering the upfront amount that patients have to pay.","Zero standard in medical training - which can often equate to substandard care. 
Extreme bureaucracy.
Complete lack of respect and concern for the protection of its front-line employees.
Paternalistic management - which can vary between departments.
No tangible incentive to work hard or well towards patient care - as that is not the where the incentives lie. In fact, most incentives encourage as less work as possible - as it often leads to less risk for the doctor, and allows more time for things which will lead to personal advancement.

★★★★★
Former Employee ",full-time, more than 5 years,12,"- Well known organization in Hong Kong (when you say that you work for HKJC people will tend to associate it positively: large organization, race courses, major events)

- Some recent executives hires (smart / competent guys) are starting to voice what should be done. The problem is that some other people, above them, are not letting them executing in this direction.","- Lack of company culture.
The tagline ""One Club, One team, One Vision"" couldn't be more off the reality. Teams are siloed and tend to not want to work with each others. Basically some teams have developed fortress around them to protect their work, knowledge and ultinatelly their job. As a result, it's a pain to get people from different teams to work together. It's even sometimes impossible.
Vision. Top managers do not articulate clearly and communicate HKJC's vision (if not that it is a world leader in horse racing). Basically, one could feel like if the whole strategy was top secret and should only be known by the board of Stuart, BoM and executives. In this context, how do you want teams to be motivated and work together in the right direction?
Also, few to no offsite. Basically, you spend all your time at the office which is a toxic situation. HKJC also celebrates individual performance (naming people during townhall), not teams.

- Company organization.
The Board of Stuart is all powerful. Surely these people are experienced and smart but i believe they are outdated and not in phase with the reality of things. They are also risk averse. Most execs know this but noone dare to say it. In a context of command and control you will be singled out and noone will support what you say. I believe the CEO is very capable but not empowed to do his job properly. In this context, the company cannot work well, you need to fix the foundation first before spending a massive amount of cash on other matters.

- Failure is not allowed. KPIs are aligned with technical performance in a context where most systems are aging. As a result people are afraid of change (it could cause incidents) and protect their silo (my silo did its job, look, here is the signature, that's must be someone else). How do you want improvement in such context? Failure is part of the learning process.

- People are not valued.
Dozens of very competent people are hired (in a way lured by what they sell you which is often different from the reality) and then leave within a year because they do not feel valued or find the working style too messy (""messy"" is a word used by hundred of people to define HKJC's working environment). 
The building at Sha Tin racecource (SCTC) is big, recent and modern however it quickly become a boring place. The rooftop area is massive but poorly utilized. There is no gym facility quicly accessible (you need at least 15 minutes to get to an old style gym room) and restaurant options are poor (the food in the building is not good / healthy).

- People are not empowered.
They treat people like dumb. A developer will spend a significant amount of her/his time in meetings and writing documentation instead of writing code.
Staff are mostly scared to voice their opinion or suggest improvements. The reason being the command and control culture in place.
HKJC also use a lot of vendors instead of relying on its internal staff to do the job. My take on this is that only vendor will stand HKJC's culture and thus do the job till the end (because they are paid to do it).
They do not invest in their own people. Training are also poor.

- Architectural decisions are poor.
This is IT specific but given that their whole business is IT based any wrong decision made here will slow you down.

- Products are too complex.
Operations are too complex, made of too many approval process (normal in a command and control culture). They should simplify operations and services / products. This is also the problem of monopolies who want every single feature instead of making economic choices. As a result, your IT and whole company is in a pain to support so many services / products.

- Creativity is absent.
I haven't seen any creative solution while working there. It goes in pair with not empowring people, fear of voicing opinion and command and control culture. As a example, they are still developig solution like QR code. The mobile apps are also extremely poor.

- Executives are too proud to listen.
Smart internal staffs and consultants have advised HKJC on what they should be doing to improve but suggestions were constantly rejected. The ""open door policy"" is not representative of a behavior of listening to people. There are cases were the staff is threatened or being talked aggressively too because they voice their opinion.

- Retaining people not competent enough. Many people have been working there for decades and life employment at HKJC is a concept that is still there. So HKJC keeps its people even if they are aggressive towards other people, low performers, putting hurdles into other people's way or else. If you are working there, you will have to deal with these people and thus waste time.

- Long working hours because of presenteeism, quantity of meetings, people not competent enough who need to be repeated multiple times what should be done. Working hours are defined such as 8:43 to 6:37 (where on earth do you see this anymore?).

At this point in time (2020) i would not suggest to work for their IT and Sustainability, HR, Marketing or other departments heavily administered. Wait at least a few years to see if their culture gets better.
Risk department may be a better working environment.
Regarding the Charities department, i don't know.

Time is your most important asset, always make best use of it.","Read the above cons.
Implement solutions asap starting with quick wins.
Stop hiding the truth and denying facts but acknowledge problems and start working on them as well as show results.
Have a talk with the Board of Stuart about this culture issue and get them to understand that in normal companies the CEO is empowered to make decisions. The BoS could be an advisory board, that's it.",2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, less than a year,3,"I worked at Jane Street for a three month trial as an experienced hire, doing research on a trading desk.

Jane Street is an awesome firm. It's the most exciting environment I've worked in — being on the trading floor feels like you're at the nexus of markets. And looking ahead, I expect the business will continue its trajectory given the growth of ETFs and the electronification of new markets, 

The talent density is very high — people are all extremely sharp. It's more diverse than most finance firms. The hierarchy is remarkably flat — everyone sits together — it's not obvious who is senior or completely new. There's a decent amount of open discussion of proprietary ideas (more than most HFs, less than most tech firms). Progression seems to be extremely fast for those who contribute.

The working day is short and intense. Almost everyone is in by 9 and most people have left by 6. During the day, people are focused — no one is reading long form journalism online, or popping out for lunch.

For those who care about this sort of thing: there's every type of lunch / snacks / drinks you could want. I ate way too many mini-toblerones.","A lot of the technology is build in-house. That's both good and bad — e.g. the code review system is a novel take on how code review should work, but it's also slow and primarily in emacs.

The firm moves quickly. People are a bit less reflective or conceptual than at other places — the focus is on doing good work and moving on. That's also consistent with the sort of work you do — there's less careful methodical research than at, say, a quant fund. (That said, there are cool tech talks / regular speakers, so it's not as narrow as that might sound.)

Feedback & accountability is stronger within teams than across departments.

Partly because there's limited structure, I got the sense there's a small group on each desk that drives the business forward, and it's not completely clear whether you'll be part of that group or not. This is more of a concern for experienced hires than those out of college.",Ration the toblerones,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,38,"Jane Street has been an incredibly rewarding experience. You are working with some of the top minds in the world, collaborating on very difficult problems. I am a trader, so I am constantly scouring the market for opportunities, tweaking our trading systems, and developing tools to help us trade more effectively. There is very little to no administrative work (outside of doing interviews), and a single hour long meeting per week.

The people here are incredibly smart, yet humble. Think of it as the very top of the ivy league math and computer science departments, so probably some of the geekiest people you've ever met will be your co-workers. However, not all departments are like that and some are extremely outgoing and charismatic (dating back to the days of floor trading I guess). Everyone is willing to help on just about anything, from the simplest questions to the advanced problems. Few are arrogant, and in fact the company will not hire you if you have an unchecked ego.

The pay is really high at the start, even compared to other trading firms. You will have no trouble securing a comfortable apartment in any part of Manhattan on the base salary alone. The bonuses are also high, and they are based on overall performance of the firm. You don't have an individual profit/loss number and never feel that an unlucky stretch will sink your bonus opportunities.

The perks are awesome, I won't go into specifics but you receive a very generous package of benefits covering just about everything you could think of. Breakfast and lunch are catered, or you can also have food delivered on the company tab. The kitchen is fully stocked with food, fruit, beverages, snacks, and candy. Jane Street really takes care of its employees.

The hours are also quite reasonable for this kind of job. You'll never have set times that you must come in and leave by. I work about 50 hours per week and am about in the middle. Some people work more, some less. There are also very few to no days where you feel that you ""must"" stay late to finish something. You never work weekends or nights.

The people are awesome. Everyone works hard while they're here, but nobody gets burned out or has unreasonable expectations. There is practically no hierarchy at all, and little to no busy work.

Finally, the firm has very high ethical standards. We will intentionally avoid strategies that, while legal, are ethically in a gray area. I've yet to run into anything truly illegal happen at this place.","The only weird downside is eating lunch at your desk. Traders don't get up from their desk more than a few times a day, and never for longer than to grab food or use the bathroom.","Keep it up, Jane Street is an amazing place to work!",5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Former Employee ",full-time, more than a year,30,"* Decision making is extremely academic and meritocratic. It's about what you know, not who you know, though politics did creep up from time to time.
* Extremely small company with heaps of awesome technology. You're guaranteed to learn a lot here.
* Most of the work that I did was extremely unique and very interesting. 
* Jane Street goes to great lengths to ensure that its staff is at least familiar with OCaml and functional programming in general. I think this is a good thing.
* Culture is extremely lax. Office hierarchy exists in name only; everyone, including their ""executive management"" is extremely warm and approachable. Casual clothes policy is great.
* The compensation is fantastic and their benefits/perks package was pretty wild. There is ALWAYS food in the office, and their gym is excellent for most of the popular training programmes out there (sports training, cardio, bodybuilding, basic powerlifting, etc).","* Resourcing problems were pretty evident. 
* Interview process was, in my opinion, too selective for certain roles.
* No true career paths for those looking to get into management, as it doesn't exist there in the same form as it exists in other places. 
* Vacation policy is surprisingly light given the rest of their benefits.
* Leaving for lunch seemed to be universally frowned upon.
* No opportunities to work from home given the nature and structure of the business.
* Lots of unproductive conversations about the smartest/most clever way of doing things, which made many meetings run unnecessarily long and introduced many ""side projects"" that slowed work in other, more key areas down.",Keep putting your people first; everything else will follow.,4.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,2.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,
