Former Employee ",full-time, less than a year,5,"- stable
- seldom work over time
- getting ITF grant is easy if external investment is involved
- getting external investment is also easy if you could provide a much cheaper offer to the investor
- good working environment, e.g. spacious working space, large desk, quiet, gorgeous sea view","- slow and a little bit of bureaucracy
- below market salary, so people are not great, some are even incompetent
- most projects are not technologically driven, but investors driven
- good for investors to have cheap product that suit their needs, but bad for engineers who want to grow and invent 
- people are generally not committing more than 60% effort, some are in 'retiring mode' or 'pretend to be busy mode'",Be honest to the employees. Let them know the reality. Let them know this is not a place for making any kind of innovation.,1.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,,,,

Former Employee ",full-time, more than a year,0,"Pseudo-retirement environment:
- Infinite money from goverment.
- No need to meet deadline.
- No need to monitor quality of work.
- It's OK even if a project fails. (somehow you get praised because you fail......)
- A normal experienced engineer only need to work less than 10% of time a day.
- Incompetent staffs can stay
- Guaranteed yearly raise higher than inflation.
- Can work till retire","Doomed job:
- 2nd hand technology, which the market does not need.
- Competent staffs are kicked away, so-called ""spin off"".
- Competence level keeps going down after 2 years of stay.
- No one can manage discipline of staffs
- Most employees cannot re-enter the job market because of high salary and incompetence.
- Once you leave ASTRI, you can really retire, because you can't find an R&D job in HK any more.","This is really a miserable job for those who really contribute to the productive flow:
- There is no clear target.
- There is no regular team meeting so staffs don't know how their procrastinations affect the others.
- Managements are so inexperienced that they don't really care about the staffs.
