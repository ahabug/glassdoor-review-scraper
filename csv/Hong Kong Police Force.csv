Current Employee ",full-time,,1,"Excellent work-life balance (except a few districts... but even if you're assigned to those busy districts, you won't be there forever) usually can leave on time, even if not, there'll be time off compensation.","Salary not very competitive compared with other translation grades in the government... say OLO (no interpretation needed).. it's quite unfair. So most people try to jump ship after probation.
Have to work on shift.",Please try to fight for a higher mps point for us... it's very unfair to us that we have to interpret & translate + work on shift yet be paid so much lower than OLO and Court I. Heard that the Management doesn't really care (cuz most of them are retiring soon anyway).,3.0,5.0,3.0,,2.0,1.0,2.0,Disapproves of CEO,,Disapproves of CEO,,,

2. Low skill (just need the skills graduated from primary school)
3. Know clearly about the selection of Police Inspector (some Inspector Police will give you tips and help you to train to enter Police Inspector, but not in an organised way)
4. May meet some seniors in Hong Kong Police Force (therefore you may have a easier life during the selection or after you successfully become Police Inspector)","1. No wifi (we could not access the computer due to the sensitivity of information. However, we need to connect the wifi for laptop. Therefore, we may need to do it after working hour or buy more mobile data or buy wifi egg)
2. Less work distributed (nearly free at all time)
3. Low-skilled work distributed (eg. make the boards)
4. Much less opportunity to learn technical skills",,2.0,5.0,2.0,,3.0,5.0,3.0,Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,,,,
