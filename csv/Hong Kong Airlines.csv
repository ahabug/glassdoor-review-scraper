Former Employee ",full-time, more than 3 years,3,"- Some of the passengers are nice, and make you smile.
- Discounted staff travel (but not as good compared to other companies).
- No two days are the same.","- Extremely poor management. The management couldn't care less about you as an employee, you're simply a number to them not a person.
-Management style is very 'mainland chinese'. They continue 'threatening' you. i.e 'If you don't do this you will be punished'.
- Very low pay compared to other airlines. 'Bonuses' are a joke, and you could only buy a cup of coffee with it.
- No company inter-departmental co-operation. Different departments don't work together so finding an answer to a question is difficult.
- HR Department is a joke. The time I was there they went through FOUR HR senior managers, so finding an answer to your question is extremely challenging.
- No redundancy payment.
- You have to put up with a LOT of challenges in the workplace. It's not an easy job, and you always go home worrying or HAVE to work for home (because if you don't HQ will call you and tell you off). The pay doesn't reflect all the things you need to go through.
- 'Staff workplace feedback surveys' are a JOKE. Why ask for feedback on how the company is performing if you're not going to act on it? And why ask us to put our name on it? Surely if you wanted our honest feedback you'd make it anonymous.","Instead of sitting in your office, come down to the airport one day and experience what we have to go through. Don't keep threatening us with disciplinary action, and let us have our days off. When you ask for our feedback on the workplace, actually act on it. No wonder why so many staff are resigning.
