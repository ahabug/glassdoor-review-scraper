Years later I still think back to how terribly run the business was/is (clearly still the case based on what is written here).,"Shaun Browne is a pathalogical liar. His word is worthless. Not only does he completely overstate his own experience and knowledge base but he must be deluded, regarding AME's standing in the industry. 

Any time an actually knowledgable or competent staff member (very few of these as all AME does is hire, and then overwork/underpay inexperienced staff), proposed (or heaven forbid proactively pursued) real anaysis Shaun would reject the suggestion.....borne out of ego and a deep mistrust for his staff. 

In my time since work at AME (approx 5yrs ago) I have gone on to work in other commoditiy based business and EVERY person I have ever spoken about having worked at AME either A) laughed and we shared stories about the time they worked there to or B) they expressed genuine disbelief at how poor the work from AME is

I laugh now whenever I see material from AME in my day to day. Many times I have actively recommended businesses I am associated with NOT to use AME simply due to its exceptionally poor standard of work.

It is amazing to me the company still has clients. The level of useful, insightful analysis behind the work is shockingly low and out of date.

Former Employee ",full-time, less than a year,2,"AME is a well-trodden path from the technical world into financial services. Many have used it as a short stepping stone and done well. A larger number have slipped and died professionally whilst trying.

Depending on the role, some people get the opportunity to meet a lot of people in the industry. It’s a very steep learning curve and some of the on-the-job training for juniors is excellent, albeit self directed.

The company is always hiring. It’s not growing, you’re just being interviewed to replace the last person who was pushed out or got fed up and resigned.","There’s a reason it’s only a stepping stone. It’s a hell hole of a place to work. About 50% of staff don’t make it through the first twelve months either failing probation or being made ‘redundant’. You should only ever accept a position with AME if you are not working and consider it a short term stint whilst you look for something else.

They pay is lousy for what is expected and the work hours are long. Contractual hours are 830am to 6pm with an hour for lunch, or 42.5 hours per week. However leaving at 6pm is frowned upon. One well-known but unwritten KPI is the time you leave. In reality, junior staff should expect to work a 45-50 hour week, and more senior staff 50-55 hours per week. Every week. A call with a client in London can mean you won’t get out of the office until 9pm. There’s no time in lieu, it’s back to the office at 830 the next morning. AME is particularly difficult for people with family commitments.

The horrendous staff turnover saps efficiency and contributes to the longer hours. Efficiency and quality is reduced by forever training new people to do the same thing. For those staff that do manage to hold on to their job, the job satisfaction is low as you can never break free of the tedium. It’s also demoralising watching your friends and colleagues be bullied and sacked one after the other.

The most vile part of AME is the toxic, back-stabbing culture that stems from the owner. He cannot relate to people and has big problems with trust. He can’t be trusted and he trusts no-one. It’s a vicious cycle. He’s convinced that every member of staff is inherently lazy and will do nothing given the opportunity. Every control system (e.g. internal office CCTV, email monitoring, keystroke logging, work hour recording) plays into this his obsession that staff are stealing (time). All decisions and expenses however small go across his desk.

At the same time, staff don’t trust management, and rightfully so given the frequent lies and u-turns. There is no honesty between staff and management. Anyone who objects to the company direction-du-jour will just end up being the next person in line to be bullied until they resign or be ‘retrenched’. Being too committed to one direction might find you favour temporarily, but once the wind changes you’re exposed.

Management is utterly ineffective and concentrated with the owner. Formal management structures have been dissolved and change on a whim. All are designed to play staff off against one another and feed information on supposed individual staff underperformance back to the owner.","If you don’t want Glass Door sit at the top of the Google results when someone searches for AME, stop placing fake reviews. The more often a page is updated, the higher in the search results it is placed by the search engine algorithms. The bland and unrealistic positive reviews invite more comments from staff who would otherwise be silent.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,,,,

Indeed I was often put in a position of either having to lie to clients about what work had been done, or having to profusely apologize for the substandard quality of the work, all while “the leadership” actually hid (and I mean actually physically hid). 

My time at AME was an eye opening experience, to see how an organisation should not be run and to work for someone I believe to be a genuinely unpleasant individual.

No, the worst thing about this company is how it will change you psychologically. It will warp you. It will corrupt you. The perverse nature of simply existing within these walls will destroy you. And the worst part is you won’t even notice it. Not until you tell friends. You’ll even joke about. You’ll say something like…

“Someone else got fired today. It’s the third one this month. And they’ve only been here for two days! Then gone, poof. I didn’t even bother remembering their name. I don’t bother remembering anyone’s name unless they’ve been here for over a month”. Then you’ll probably laugh. HAHAHAHAHA.

Your friends will be shocked. They’ll probably say something like. “I can’t believe such a terrible place exists. You have to leave”. And you’ll just shrug it off. Maybe you’ll blame the terrible job market. Or maybe you'll point out the fact that rent doesn’t pay itself. However, it doesn’t change the fact you laughed.

Think about it. You laughed, you mocked someone in the exact same situation as you. They also exist in a terrible job market and I bet they have to pay rent too. You saw someone in the same terrible situation as you and you joked and laughed at their misery. 

Aren’t you also miserable? Of course you are. You work at AME. Why are you laughing at someone in the exact same situation as you? Would you laugh a homeless person on the street? Or someone lying on a hospital bed? I know the laughter is ironic. It is the cynical snickering that comes from black humour. Everyone here shares the same fate. United in adversity, as you will read in all the other reviews. But ask yourself. Right now. As someone who has not been tainted by AME. Would you laugh if someone else got fired for doing nothing wrong in their first few days? If you’re already at AME, it is too late. But hey, at least there’s beer on Friday right? 

And this is why AME is so terrible. It is so cancerous that it strips you of basic human compassion. If you work here you will no longer be able to look at people as if they were actually people. New people are just sacrifices, a fresh batch of souls cooking in the oven for the CEO. Working here will remove something that is basically ingrained into you at birth because you cannot believe something so perversely inhumane (the CEO) has the audacity to assume the form of a normal functioning human being.

Beware the wolf in sheep’s clothing. If he’s charming to you in the interview (if you even get what could pass off as an interview), press the Glassdoor button. He will be so flustered you’ll think English is his second language. He might even get out some paper and draw a lot of diagrams to prove god knows what.","How to Make a Painkiller (Cocktail)

Former Employee ",full-time,,33,Your colleagues are generally decent and united in the shared disrespect of Shaun Brown.,"The problems with AME lie directly with the owner, Shaun Browne. At best, his management is comically awful with compulsive decision making, value-destroying about-turns and a child-like understanding of the technical aspects of the mining and oil and gas industries. At worst, Shaun Browne is a chronic bully - mentally, verbally and physical. He appears to contrive tension by pitting staff against each other. Senseless personnel changes are ongoing and poorly communicated. You could suddenly be reporting to someone else or, unbeknownst to you, people reporting to you could suddenly be reporting to a different colleague. 
Shaun Browne has a Trump-like ego and is blithely unaware of his own ineptitude. He has owned this business for over 25 years and literally knows nothing else outside those four walls. It is painfully obvious to even the youngest of analysts who have worked in professionally-run organisations that he is quite clueless. Unfortunately this makes Shaun Browne quite condescending and will constantly remind the staff that he has ""being doing this longer than anyone else"" and considers that justification for his poor decision making.
If you’re going for a BD role, do not expect to last for longer than 6 months. Otherwise, if you show any initiative you will be exploited mercilessly and dumped after a couple of years. The office is made up with those trying to work out what is going and those that are trying to leave. Do not fall for his faux charm and self-deprecation - it is fake as the positive reviews he organises for this site.","It is painfully obvious, to both employees and clients, how bad a job you're doing.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,38,"Everyday is one day closer to death! If you can last more than a year at AME, that is worth putting on your Resume.","DO NOT BELIEVE ANY POSITIVE POSTS ABOUT AME!!

The only thing worse than working at AME is knowing that AME can pay third party companies, or even Glassdoor itself to remove some of the negative posts and place higher weighting to positive comments, that have been clearly written by the owner or his immediate family. I have previously been tasked with signing up to 'Internet Reputation' companies that we pay to try to improve our image on Glassdoor.

If you are applying for a Business Development or Human Resources position, don't bother! I my 2 years here I have not seen anyone last more than 4 months, most last only a week or so.

Turnover here is huge, circa 60-70% per year. The people that stay (myself included) are either brainwashed, have limited opportunities elsewhere due to the market, or are just starting out and need to prove themselves.

There are no perks, the owner of the company tries to be charming but once you're there he will dictate every aspect of your employment down to the colour short you wear, where you will sit (which changes weekly), and he even tries to interfere with people's personal lives. To say the owner is a micromanager is the understatement of the year.

Nightmares will become commonplace. Long hours are expected. You will be given 10 times the amount of work that would normally be expected. Your job title will change monthly and if you are good at your job, he will pile more and more work on that person until they break. It is heartbreaking to see because these are some of the best people I have ever worked with. Without the owners constant interfering and crazy behaviour, this company could go places. Unfortunately the company remains stagnant, always trying to replace lost staff, instead of focussing on what it's good at.

Please do not accept a job here unless you have absolutely no choice. But if you do, to sum up a post put up here about a year ago, you will find we are 'together in adversity!'

Contact current or ex-staff to confirm all this.","Remove the owner from the day to day operations of this company and maybe there would be a chance for this company to succeed and for the culture to improve.

- When the boss is overseas, the environment improves immensely and you may do your job well
- If you're starting out on the path of your career, this is a good stepping stone—so long as you only stay here as long as is respectable with regards to your resume
- Some positions allow you to clock off at your contracted time and leave your work at work (although, most expect overtime on an almost daily basis)
- If you do your job well and help others wherever possible, you will likely make firm friends through respect and trust","- The boss doesn't know where the company is going (or if he does know where he wants it to go, he can't make up his mind how to get there, so be prepared to work your fingers off on a whim of his, to then have all that work disregarded the next week, to then be forced to focus on something else)
- You will get intimidated by the boss on a daily basis, whether he's in the office or overseas
- High turnover rate of staff, due to dissatisfaction with the work environment, intimidation, stress and lack of respect shown by upper management, which means you will likely have to make friends quickly, and see them leave soon after
- Quantity is valued over quality, so don't expect to do your best work here
- Staff members are overworked and not remunerated for extra efforts or overtime
- Culture of backstabbing and mistrust is rampant
- Family-run business, so the boss thinks he's a king and you are his servants
- Do not expect your suggestions to be taken seriously—you are there to carry out orders, no matter how illogical they may be
- The boss will charm you into thinking he values your opinions, but he doesn't, he simply wants to deceive you about his true character—but you will learn in time and through experience
- If you are considering work experience here as part of a degree, be prepared for a hard slog—you will be treated terribly, the system will not be explained to you in full and you will likely walk away from the experience with a warped view of the industry

Executive management sets the strategy (milestones and targets) to each research manager. These carry precise expectations regarding schedule and budget. At the same time there is great autonomy on how to conduct the research.
Typically research teams will have young engineers supporting senior consultants with lots of field experience. So work provides many opportunities to meet experts in the field, but is also lively and full of young ambitious people. Friday beers are almost like a religion.
Working hours are normal. But the environment extremely fast-paced and targets are always set to challenge the team. Improving productivity, quality and developing new products dominate management agenda since I joined. Ruthless pursuit for improvement that can be contagious, especially because management is fast in identifying and promoting good workers/ideas. But if you are not a competitive self-motivated person, this might not be the place for you. I have seen plenty of turnovers related to this mentality.
If you are highly driven, the learning curves are astonishing. Even though each team deals with training in their own way, engineering and economic experience abound. There is always an area of expertise new employees don’t have experience with, be it the economic valuation / marketing strategy, or the technical engineering side of natural resource projects.","AME is a family-owned business, this means decision making is fast and responsive but also very concentrated on the Executive Director.

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,28,The offices are clean. Commodities can be an interesting field to work in. Some exposure to clients.,"Management is highly intrusive- all emails are monitored. There are cameras recording the office all day. High staff turnover - an office of 20 saw 53 people come and go last year - management holds an attitude that everyone is dispensable, and is clear to communicate it. Management promises (pay rises, etc) are frequently broken. Training and development is not adequate.",Be more honest in how you conduct yourselves. Stop hiring and firing so many people - so many people have moved or left other jobs to join AME only to be fired within a week or two. Invest in staff development.,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Disapproves of CEO,,,
