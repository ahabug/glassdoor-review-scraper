If you're not in engineering or the technical side of the house, you're nearly a second class citizen.

Nevertheless, when engineering does put out a new feature or product it's actually an A+ ship. 

Sales is a catch 22. Really strong team members, not enough good managers. Marketing is in the same position as sales.

The people are what make it. While I've been at GitHub, I've had incredible conversations about how to be a better person, how to encourage more women to enter tech, and how to make the open source community a better place. All of these conversations have so far been informal and outside of GitHub's larger strategies for social impact. I'm just happy to work among such thoughtful people. 

It's been great to get to know my coworkers even though I'm working remotely. It's hard sometimes, but I feel like GitHub gives remote employees many opportunities to meet each other and feel like they're still part of the team. If I start feeling weird or excluded, I can express that and something will change to make me feel more included. I also know I can take a trip to San Francisco and work with my team for a week or two. 

Finally, it doesn't hurt that the benefits are insane. There are a few I haven't even taken advantage of, yet, because they seem so extravagant. I feel taken care of to say the least.","There is some tension as the company grows and changes. People who've been working at GitHub for a while seem to sense that it is losing something—it's open culture, maybe. I think there are people who are actively fighting against this loss, and overall it is heading in the right direction. It does cause some awkwardness, though, and I do hope we can maintain what people feel was so special.

As I said, working remotely is tough. Sometimes I feel like I would be better at my job if I worked at HQ, just for the exposure to serendipitous interactions and the ability to yell across the room at my coworkers.","Encourage and maintain communication. In fact, over-communicate whenever possible.

0,0,0,"June 8, 2015",23:52:57,"Great company, great colleagues, great :heart:", Software Engineer,"Remote, OR",Current Employee ,full-time, more than a year,23,"The best part about working at GitHub is the great colleagues! They are uniformly friendly, super talented, and have a positive, supportive attitude. All the engineers I have worked with have been really motivated and produce high-quality work.

A majority of GitHub employees work remotely; some in small satellite offices but most at home/cafes/shared office space/whatever. Because of this, the company goes to a lot of effort to make remote work effective. Communications are largely asynchronous (e.g., via GitHub issues and pull requests), most meetings are streamed and recorded, and there are lots of chances to meet other GitHubbers when necessary: the annual company summit, mini-summits for departments or teams kicking off a project, plus we are welcome to travel to visit HQ or other GitHubbers when we feel the urge to connect. Most ""synchronous"" discussion takes place in online chat, though even here transcripts are kept for anybody to read. Time zones can be a real hassle but otherwise it all works quite well. It's so awesome being able to work for a San Francisco-based company while being able to live almost anywhere!

The company is very transparent. Many company-wide issues are discussed in the open, and anybody's input is welcome.

Until the beginning of 2014, GitHub didn't have any formal management structure to speak of. The result was predictable: people worked on what they found exciting, but it was hard to gather critical mass to implement large-scale projects. Since then people-managers have been introduced, which has improved the company focus. So far management has used a relatively light touch. In particular, work is still mostly organized by the engineers working on it rather than top-down by management. In my opinion the introduction of management has improved the company, though it has definitely caused a shift in the culture.

GitHub the company also seems to have a good heart. As far as I can tell, everybody at the company from top to bottom is really trying hard to do the right thing:

* There is a constant internal dialog about how to improve diversity, both within GitHub (e.g., by doing everything we can to eliminate bias in our recruiting processes) and also within the whole industry (for example by supporting organizations and events that are targeted at underrepresented groups). This isn't just an HR goal; we are all thinking about it.
* We do everything we can to support open-source software. Most obviously, we provide free Git hosting to open-source projects, and we give our free users every bit the same level of support as we give to our paying customers. We contribute internally-developed code to upstream open-source projects as much as possible. We have ""open-source Fridays"" twice a month when GitHubbers are encouraged to work on open source projects. We sponsor many open-source conferences and other events.
* GitHub promotes a healthy work-life balance. I guess (being alpha-geeks) a lot of us work too many hours. But that pressure doesn't come from the company. I've never seen anything but encouragement for people announcing vacation (which is unlimited) or taking parental leave (4 months PTO for new parents).

Finally, it's great to build a product that millions of people use and love. It's a pleasure to run into GitHub users in real life because they are so positive about the company. We're helping to propagate the open-source ethos:

* We provide a great place for open-source projects to host their code.
* Companies use GitHub to promote code-sharing and communal development internally, and often to open-source internal projects.
* There are even governments that put draft legislation in GitHub and allow citizens to propose pull requests to change it.

Reading back over what I've written, it sounds like I'm a marketing shill. But in fact I'm just a very happy software engineer. After nearly two years at the company I am still almost giddy that I get to work at GitHub.","Remote work impedes serendipitous communication. It's an effort to keep up with what is happening in the rest of the company when you don't bump into your colleagues in the kitchen or in the elevator.

As a hangover from the management-free days, it can sometimes still be hard to figure out who is in charge of what.","With employees the caliber of GitHub's, a little management goes a long way. Be careful not to allow management to grow into a separate caste. Especially, don't let it evolve into a dynamic where edicts flow down and no information/feedback flows up.

We don't have much of a presence outside of the walls we work in when it comes to Glassdoor, Linkedin and other sites that potential employees do the usual poking around in before they apply. I was cautious to throw my name into the hat for these very reasons. 

Each article I pulled up was outdated and a lot of the information I was able to obtain was from unreliable sources, or went against everything that I felt could be true after talking with the team and meeting them in person. Was GitHub just really good at making me think they were an awesome company, or were they really as awesome as they seemed to be, but never cared to tell people about it? 

After joining the team (one of the best decisions I have made in my career), I can now tell you with confidence that it is because word simply never got out about just how great being a GitHubber truly is. 

- Work with people who still have passion. With the flexible hours and unlimited vacation, I was finally able to join a team that not only worked hard, but had yet to be completely burned out. 
- Put your family first. GitHub gets it. We all have lived outside of work and they understand that these lives take precedent over something 9-5. They offer maternity and paternity leave, which I was thrilled to hear about. 
- Dogs at work. If you have a dog, this is heaven. If you don't, even better. You can play with someone else's and then say goodbye when you leave for home. 
- Flexibility with what you do and how you do it. Take on those additional projects and offer your extra time to different teams. They encourage cross team training and the company is small enough to make it a reality.

They burnt out any kind of good will they had post acquisition and seem intent on getting rid of any ""pre-acquisition"" employee.

 If you weren't working for Microsoft before the acquisition, it's likely your voice doesn't count. Experience is being dismissed in favour of whoever can get a hold of the CEO.

As a result, ICs are burnt out from the constant disregard, as well as the incessant change of vision and strategy.

They do place a significant amount of trust on each employee to do what is right for the company, the customer and the values that we have to uphold. In saying this, if you are a self-motivated individual, you should find that GitHub is a place where you can truly thrive!

1. Remote Work. Don't come in with preconceived notions. This is the real deal. You have the autonomy to pretty much create your own workflow. So don't feel guilty about that 30 minute nap after lunch on a Wednesday!

2. Benefits. The benefits rock. Especially the T&E. Nope I'm not gonna be the one to spill the beans but you will be well satisfied upon receiving your benefits package!

3. Positive environment. I read the earlier posts. I am somewhat newer so maybe I am still wearing rose colored glasses. But honestly, there seems to be an extremely positive culture.","1. Sense of Entitlement. I do feel that some workers internally have a sense of entitlement type of feeling. As such, being as GitHub has generally been a company that empowers its workers, anytime something is changed to safeguard the company as a whole, or if something is implemented that doesn't go with someone's exact suggestion, people can get a bit touchy feely about it. (Hence some of the earlier reviews I imagine). The grass is NOT always greener on the other side.

2. Onboarding. I loved onboarding. But it is quite confusing. This is always going to be a challenge with a company that focuses on being distributed like we are. But it is a notable challenge especially to some.","I like my managers and my team. I don't feel as if I am 'too junior,' to sync up with high Leadership on a consistent basis. My overall feeling is that most people are truly trying their best here at GitHub.

The lessons I’ve learned working here, the people I’ve met, and the memories I’ll take away—are some of the most valuable things I’ve had the opportunity to experience.","Kind of like Animal Farm, in company form…? Convoluted internal politics and history, heavily skewed against empowering remote employees to have influence on decisions or visibility into context. Lots of backchannel communication. Zero clarity for career progression and upward (or sideways) mobility. Poor feedback systems (both positive and critical), with very little meaningful action resulting from feedback processes. Many managers with poor people skills, and/or unmotivated to be good managers. No consistent management philosophy. Management is explicitly and actively discouraging community involvement.","Identify frustrated high performers before they turn bitter (such a shame to see this happen to so many incredibly talented people I knew). Train managers better. Identify managers who are simply coasting, and give people who want to be managers because they care about people a chance. Listen to remote employees more (especially those who are non-US too). Help all employees understand GitHub’s management philosophy (if there is one?), so managers who don’t embody it can improve or be replaced.

But the most important thing? Double-down on the community, or risk being disrupted. It is bat-shit crazy to see GitHub management actively discouraging motivated, long-serving employees from contributing to the community in form of conference talks/booth duty. Having people who work on the product interface directly with the community will be key.",5.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,5.0,3.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,"May 8, 2017 – People Operations Team"

Good benefits.","Senior engineering management changes in the last year have resulted in micro-mangement, demoralizing of teams, disrespect for the work of engineers and being tone deaf to the acual problems that engineers raise. Engineering teams can spend more effort appeasing certain leaders and figuring out how to avoid interaction with them than on soliciting customer feedback.",If you keep the new leadership you are going to lose your best talent.
