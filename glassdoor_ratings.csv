1,0,0,Featured Review,,Great Company and Great Mission!, Operations Supervisor,"Portland, OR",Former Employee ,full-time, more than 5 years,0,"- Great Benefits
- Creative, driven, and hard working colleagues
- Global teams = diverse perspectives 
- Focused on growth mindset leadership 
- Great for beginning and mid career growth.","- Since it's global, it never ""shuts off"" - meetings can sometimes be early or late in the day
- Extremely fast paced, decisions sometimes made w/o consults, or decision not made because too many ""cooks in the kitchen"" 
- If you are outside of the SF offices, it can be sometimes hard to connect with other staff.","Please continue to focus on diverse hiring, more women, LGBTQIA+, and POC in leadership roles (including the board and all the way up to E-Staff).",5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO

Employees in roles with no real experience but education. Huge imbalance.,"I worked supporting the talent team for 1 year globally. I found the inner dynamics to be hostile at best. My indirect manager would micromanage my work, talk poorly about me to my peers and my employees, belittle me in meetings, and orchestrate situations for her sick pleasure. Her leader seemed aloof and unengaged - It was hostile - she was left with a lot of responsibility and she bred an environment of nastiness. Airbnb prides itself on having a great working environment and superb ethics and values but treats their vendors, freelancers, temps, and contractors like garbage. Airbnb was one of the worst experiences in the workforce I have ever had as I was hospitalized for stress. The only thing Airbnb gave me was depression and anxiety.",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Approves of CEO
