Very inflexible to change, reluctance to adopt new ideas and suggestions in improving work processes.

Expect to work until 11pm on multiple days a week just to meet departmental expectations.
HR statistics on OT were also skewed, I witnessed first hand, how some colleagues had to deliberately submit heavily edited reports on working hours, cutting the actual OT hours worked in the past month by more than 80% just to provide a visually appealing result back to the HR department.
Many colleagues share negative sentiments on the work life balance upon joining, and are simply looking to get the experience and move on to the next, better workplace as soon as possible","Be able to take criticism, or even advice from employees.

2) An opportunity to be a leader due to its current aggressive hiring policy (There is a lack of System QA talents in Singapore due to the job scope is not actively learnt in the university, unlike example, Java / Python developer or DBA)
3) Lots of benefits, including Union membership, Gym within company compound and 18 days of annual leave (Longer than standard 14 days elsewhere)
4) Annual Bonus can be up to 3 months, subjected to meeting / exceeding KPI","1) This role requires a developer thinking mindset, and also a Project Manager thinking mindset.

A System QA Engineer is like a goal keeper, the last line of defence against buggy implementation / or implementation that dont meet either functional or non-functional requirement.

Therefore, the skillsets required for this role can be quite demanding.

2) The working hours is 10am to 7pm, some people find it a concern due to the office is located in a relatively inaccessible area (Lack of food choices within the area after evening)

3) This is a role under ""Engineering"" department, which requires 2 months of notice period if the employee ever wished to resign. It is considered longer than usual 1 month notice period.

4) For those who wanted to gain ""International exposure"" (Working abroad beyond Singapore) as career goals, this role is probably not suitable. 

Despite Shopee has QA teams abroad (Mainly in Shenzhen and Taipei), there is no known policy of transferring Singapore based employees to its local office abroad (Except its Management Leadership Programme). However as a Singapore based company, it offers work visa and PR sponsorship for people who wished to settle in Singapore.

Currently, there is a possibility for current employees based in Singapore to request for a job role changes subjected to certain performance requirements.","I would like to see a path for non-Management Leadership Programme employees can gain overseas exposure whereby Singaporean employees can request to be transferred into Taipei, Shenzhen, KL etc. offices subjected to suitability and the role availability",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,

5. Turnover is extremely high.

6. Don't expect perks to be equal or near the level of FAANG.","1. Be more selective in hiring!!!! I have seen so many unqualified experienced hires joining teams that they have absolutely no experience in. 

2. Shopee's aggressive marketing and hiring process may have portrayed themslves as really desperate and may have earned them a poor reputation.

3. Work on branding. Shopee lacks the 'premium status' as compared to other ecommerce platforms.

4. Work on reputation in the job market. Curate and headhunt for people who are truly qualified for their roles.

Reporting officer title for show, no say or authority in anything. No decision-making power as well, literally like a pet to its owner with a golden food bowl as a reward for being a ""good boy"" all these years.

- No appreciation. At least leaders can learn to say simple 'thank you' or 'please.' I think it's quite different between treating someone as a team member, or as a servant.

Have the facade of an established MNC due to all the funding they get but they are really just a start up.

Micromanaging like crazy, enforce that you must turn on camera for video calls, even for those calls with crazy amount of attendees (50>). Their excuse is to give more ""office-like"" feel but really, it's just to make sure you are in front of your pc during the entire course of meeting (1-2 hours). On the topic of meeting, you will be required to attend irrelevant meeting that takes up your work time then expect you to do unpaid OT to finish up your task.

Good name on resume but bad experience on work life. They may offer a higher salary, especially for fresh grads but that is just to trap you in because other companies won't pay as high. Once you're trap, they can overwork you however they want and you can't do anything about it because you can't find another job that pays as well due to your lack of experience. You can't leave unless you take a pay cut, but if you are experienced hire then it's not as bad. Think carefully before joining.","Hi former employee,

Thank you for dropping us your feedback and review based on your experience with Shopee.

Would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your contribution so far with Shopee and we are saddened to see you leave. 

In Shopee , we thrive to provide you with fruitful development throughout your career with us. One of the key things we are very focused on is the well being of our employees and hence, its reflected on how we try to ensure a conducive working environment for all our employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life. 

We will look into this matter and continuously improve our employee welfare and benefit. 

Into a more heavier topic - we would like to clarify; during COVID19 situation, all of us are required to adjust to a new way of working such as working remotely and online meetings. Hence, Shopee came up with our work-from-home guideline to ensure effective working is still maintained between you and your team. One of the key examples is making video available during meetings. This is believed to ensure all team members are engaged throughout the meeting to ensure effective meeting outcome can be achieved; regardless the meeting size is 10 or >10 pax. Hope you understand. 

On another note- we are keen to hear from you further because we believe in valuable lessons of learning from the feedback. If you are open to share, I am inviting you to drop an email to us at 
at [hr.experience@shopee.com] and hopefully we can improve better on our employee engagement, welfare and benefit.

0,0,0,"September 16, 2020",23:36:07,Your experience will be largely based on your manager and whether or not you are Chinese, Product Manager,Singapore,Current Employee ,full-time,,0,"- Very fast paced 
- Business has grown exceptionally well over the years
- Great office facilities such as gym etc. (although you probably wont have time to use it)
- Lots of interesting events hosted by people team
- Decent salary and option to get equity for those that meet the seniority requirements","Senior managers (team leads) are by far the single worse thing about working in Shopee, all other cons pale in comparison. These managers have the autonomy to set their own culture within their team. 

In most companies, there are bad managers but they are usually kept in check by HR from becoming too extreme. However at Shopee, HR has no oversight or visibility on what goes on within the teams, they are simply too busy with recruiting. Also, you cannot complain to HR about your manager because there is so much political BS going on, there's a chance your complaint will be traced back to you in which case your manager will show you the door. 



1. Work life balance
- E-commerce is a 24/7, 365 days business, if you‚Äôre in product/ tech etc. you may be called at any time, even while you‚Äôre on holiday 
- Not responding in group chats within ~30mins is frowned upon, they will escalate to your manager and you will get scolded. Thus you end up checking your phone every 10mins or so (over weekend, outings with friends etc) to make sure the on-going group chats do not involve you 
- Some managers are known to ""test"" new employees by sending them tasks on weekends to determine how long it takes for them to respond. Managers will use these stupid tests to form an opinion of how ‚Äúhard working‚Äù they are 


2. Micromanagement 
- Shopee managers are notorious for being micromanagers. I believe this culture is largely driven top down from the C-suite leaders who tend to see micromanagement positively as ""having paying attention to detail"" 


3. Chinese culture/ language
- If you can‚Äôt speak Chinese, don‚Äôt bother joining. 
- CEO has publicly said to focus hiring on PRCs and not Singaporeans as Singaporeans tend to be ‚Äòlazier‚Äô i.e. complain more about work-life balance etc, which I guess is kind of true since no such thing exists in China 
- Taking long leave i.e. >5days is frowned upon. The attitude is ‚Äòyou should feel grateful you have a job here‚Äô. My managers complained about me to my peers behind my back while i was on leave for 8 days (I was getting married in another country) 
- If you‚Äôre in tech, most meetings are conducted in Chinese, PRDs are in Chinese, most dev's english ability range from poor to none at all



4. Unprofessional team leads/ managers 
- Some managers even publicly scolded their team members for: leaving office on time (regardless of whether work is completed) 
- Feedback is never direct, it's always done behind people‚Äôs back or you get scolded on the office floor in front of everyone to ‚Äúsend a message‚Äù to others 


Team leads have little experience leading people 
Team leads are mostly appointed by being in ‚Äúthe right place at the right time‚Äù ~3 years ago when Shopee was a small start up, they survive by expertly managing the office politics 
Team leads do not have sufficient experience to understand the complexity of your task, frankly they don‚Äôt care until something is delayed or there is an issue. Then they will interrogate you until they can find something to scold you for
Team leads do not have sufficient experience to provide meaningful mentorship to their direct reports. Some leads have 10+ direct reports, they simply don't have the time either","Hi current employee, thank you for taking time to leave a review.

Narrow career path: Brainwash is popular there and people are working extremely hard to fight for promotions while senior managers prefer hiring externals rather than promoting people internally. 

If you want to explore other departments, don‚Äôt think about it, many dirty actions are waiting for you.

Bad management: Top down culture especially being told it is top down directly in the dept. Inconsistent decision making, incapable managers with terrible micromanagement and bad scope management. Result driven and squeeze people with tight deadline while do not care about how late people are staying in the office. Senior leads care about own interests which are against company‚Äôs interests.

Hence cannot provide KPI for most of the staffs. No clear career progression, very hard to go for higher rank despite achievement and years of experience working in Shopee.
HR is not doing their part to improve our working condition, they keep hiring people but the desk did not increase desk space as fast, I can forsee we will be cramping everywhere after Covid ends. 
HR is does not allow feedbacks and cannot handle criticism. They closed the company group chat because too many people complaint in it. But they did not address to those complaint or even respond to the complaint within the group chat, of course people will be complaining. Now they closed it, all the complaints that can be settled internally will be open to public in Glassdoor / jobstreet etc. 
They are also very slow in hiring process even for urgent positions. Whenever we refer our friends in they did not even responded to our request and rejected. Even friends who previously worked as sellers in Shopee also failed their first screening for urgent position. 
Pay is definitely on the low end. For current employee you can try to search for the same task and being offered better pay somewhere else.
There is no increment of annual leave even after working here for years.
Biggest favouritism is where Ian only focus on BD and Marketing. BD team at times can make mistakes costing the company up to 100K++ losses but was not penalized or taken action upon. Promoting a culture of ""no big deal"" making such mistakes from their end.

3. Good place to grow one's network as one gets to connect with people from different walks of life","1. Little to no career progression prospects
- This is true especially for local employees in the PH as Shopee likes to hire expats to fill roles instead of promoting dedicated existing workers
- Shopee hires a lot because of the very high turnover rate (possibly due to the first reason)

2. Distasteful Office Politics from Upper Management
- can be attributed to reason 1 as well
- Expats hired in upper management end up hiring more expats instead of promoting dedicated existing employees

3. The company is merely a disruptor to it's competitor, Lazada
- every single action taken by Shopee is geared towards beating Lazada, despite it being at the expense of their employees and sellers
- the company is merely a disruptor in this sense. Which is why instead of focusing on developing its people and constituents, Shopee merely focuses on implementing quick band-aid solutions instead of having long term plans in developing the company and it's people further. All because they really have to beat Lazada.

4. Uneven ratio of Workload and Pay
- You may be given a significant amount of workload and roles compared to another employee, however he/she can be paid the same or sometimes even more
- better to come in the company as someone with experience rather than a fresh grad if you are looking for high pay
- Having even a sliver of extra work experience can mean having double the salary compared to a fresh grad, despite having the exact same role as them","Stop lying to your employees.

Worst part is when you are tasked to do something and is already in the midst of it, another set of instructions can arrive all of a sudden resulting in you changing the entire way you are doing the current task, which is really frustrating and time wasting
- some departments have great culture difference; there are some depts which comprises of mostly China internationals and as much as I have to agree they are good and responsible in their work, you will still feel left out if you join such department due to the culture difference, and worst, language barrier.

- pantry stocked most of the time","- The fact that most of the reviews about the pros of working in Shopee is mainly compensation based speaks volumes about the culture of the people here. It feels like the only reason most people work here/retain here are because they are paid adequately enough to forgo the ugly parts of the company. As it stands, it feels like I'm only here to do my job adequately enough just to collect salary, I wouldnt 'champion' working here to others.
- The mass hiring rate means that most of the time, new hires were made just to meet numbers rather than showing the right profile culture & competency wise.
- There is a top down feeling of toxicity as well where people generally see the worst in each other and often display either two faced treatment/favourtism
- They like to advertise how 'fun' or 'innovative' it is in here to portray the image of a company that is willing to try new things, but that is far from the case internally. Most new suggestions are often turned down by people in more senior positions because 'its now how we usually do things here' or 'we always did it this way instead'
- Shopee's standard response to negative feedback is alway 'we are still a startup', which quite frankly cant be further from the group. Although Shopee is less than a decade old, according the Malaysia SME Corp guidelines, startups are supposed to be less than 6 months of operation.. We are also strongly financially backed and have a strong presence in multiple countries across south east asia and brazil as well. How can we still go forward with this 'start up mentality' if we are already such a global brand?
- HR displays a sense of toxicity as well in that they always assume the worst in the rest of the people. When people ask genuine questions, its always retorted sarcastically or in disgust. There is also a lot of talking behind other employees back as well. As a function that is supposed to champion the needs of employees without forgoing business needs, it feels like the HR here always assumes and expects the worst of the company while putting themselves on a high stool.
- Company wants to retain talent, yet are not necessarily taking action in initiatives that will address this. It feels like the only way Shopee can think to retain people is to throw things at them during special occasions/celebrations, but even then, budget cuts means the quality of things get worst each time.
- I dont think i even need to go into work-life balance as the working hours here are so rigid we even have to tap in and out each time to have our attendance recorded. Feels like high school all over again, even college/uni didnt require us to do something like this.

I've been here less than a year and I already feel all these things, and my review is not the only one that mentions these things.",Culture starts from top down.

Fancy new office, gym, fully stocked pantry etc..

Once you take that away, Shopee is nothing but a company that micro-manages its staff, over-working them, stingy when it comes to compensation and extremely elitist when it comes to hiring. The first thing they consider is if you have upper tier honors/from local uni or not.

They are not like this initially. I think they need to re-evaluate their position and stop sticking their heads up in the clouds. 

I have friends that were rejected from Shopee, simply because they do not go to a local university. They would much rather hire a fresh grad from a local uni.

Secondly, career progression is vague. There is no clear charted path for you from your manage despite discussions. Performance review is based on arbitrary ratings and KPI's were not clearly defined.

Thirdly, there is no work life balance. Half days on major holidays (CNY etc) is subjected to Manager's approval. And half days are from 3pm onward. If you were to take leave, its equivalent to an entire day off. 0 flexibility.

The style of working as well, is very very very micro. Weekly lengthy reports done on Powerpoint slides (smh) and having meetings with CEO every single week.

I think this is a major concern as Chinese is the main language of communication and if Shopee still hires non-Chinese speaking people to fill roles that require close working relationships with these PRCs, how can it be expected that they can perform well if they cannot even communicate well? This is extremely demoralising for non-Chinese speakers. Some PRCs do not even have sufficient English speaking skills to be able to carry out a conversation. I think it should be made clear during interviews that proficiency in Chinese is mandatory (at least be upfront about it!) and Shopee should not offer someone a job if they know that they cannot speak Chinese well. Requesting the PRCs to speak English during meetings just blatantly widens the cultural gap and as mentioned, some cannot even conduct meetings in English. This has been raised in previous reviews but I don't think anything has been done to improve the situation. However, it definitely needs to be looked into and I hope that Shopee HR and management take this seriously.","Hi current employee, thank you for taking time out to leave us a review. Communication is extremely important and we understand your frustration. It must have been an issue that has been your heart for some time.

You might think that only the top management has to deal with his nonsense, that's where you're wrong. He likes to micromanage the smallest things, so chances are you will have to go through him even if you are in a junior position.

They had a fancy engineer appreciation day at a hotel, projects are usually done in favour of engineers timeline and effort even if it means the results will be undesirable for the product. If you are not an engineer, expect to be treated like a second class employee.

- HR likes to say that they are trying their best to diversify the workplace and hire from different cultures. But truth is, the work culture in Shopee is very Cheena, so usually they end up hiring Chinese people and preferably PRCs because those tend to fit in better. The hard truth is that Shopee's culture is not made to embrace diversity because if you can't do it the Cheena way (not questioning your leaders even if they're wrong which sometimes means enabling a toxic environment, doing things by copying instead of thinking, staying back late and pretending to do work so that it appears as if you are hardworking), you don't deserve to work here.",Seems like the CEO is the main cause of all the problems in the company,1.0,4.0,1.0,,2.0,4.0,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,Disapproves of CEO
