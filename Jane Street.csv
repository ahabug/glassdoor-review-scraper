Current Employee ",full-time, less than a year,3,"I worked at Jane Street for a three month trial as an experienced hire, doing research on a trading desk.

Jane Street is an awesome firm. It's the most exciting environment I've worked in — being on the trading floor feels like you're at the nexus of markets. And looking ahead, I expect the business will continue its trajectory given the growth of ETFs and the electronification of new markets, 

The talent density is very high — people are all extremely sharp. It's more diverse than most finance firms. The hierarchy is remarkably flat — everyone sits together — it's not obvious who is senior or completely new. There's a decent amount of open discussion of proprietary ideas (more than most HFs, less than most tech firms). Progression seems to be extremely fast for those who contribute.

The working day is short and intense. Almost everyone is in by 9 and most people have left by 6. During the day, people are focused — no one is reading long form journalism online, or popping out for lunch.

For those who care about this sort of thing: there's every type of lunch / snacks / drinks you could want. I ate way too many mini-toblerones.","A lot of the technology is build in-house. That's both good and bad — e.g. the code review system is a novel take on how code review should work, but it's also slow and primarily in emacs.

The firm moves quickly. People are a bit less reflective or conceptual than at other places — the focus is on doing good work and moving on. That's also consistent with the sort of work you do — there's less careful methodical research than at, say, a quant fund. (That said, there are cool tech talks / regular speakers, so it's not as narrow as that might sound.)

Feedback & accountability is stronger within teams than across departments.

Partly because there's limited structure, I got the sense there's a small group on each desk that drives the business forward, and it's not completely clear whether you'll be part of that group or not. This is more of a concern for experienced hires than those out of college.",Ration the toblerones,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Current Employee ",full-time, more than a year,38,"Jane Street has been an incredibly rewarding experience. You are working with some of the top minds in the world, collaborating on very difficult problems. I am a trader, so I am constantly scouring the market for opportunities, tweaking our trading systems, and developing tools to help us trade more effectively. There is very little to no administrative work (outside of doing interviews), and a single hour long meeting per week.

The people here are incredibly smart, yet humble. Think of it as the very top of the ivy league math and computer science departments, so probably some of the geekiest people you've ever met will be your co-workers. However, not all departments are like that and some are extremely outgoing and charismatic (dating back to the days of floor trading I guess). Everyone is willing to help on just about anything, from the simplest questions to the advanced problems. Few are arrogant, and in fact the company will not hire you if you have an unchecked ego.

The pay is really high at the start, even compared to other trading firms. You will have no trouble securing a comfortable apartment in any part of Manhattan on the base salary alone. The bonuses are also high, and they are based on overall performance of the firm. You don't have an individual profit/loss number and never feel that an unlucky stretch will sink your bonus opportunities.

The perks are awesome, I won't go into specifics but you receive a very generous package of benefits covering just about everything you could think of. Breakfast and lunch are catered, or you can also have food delivered on the company tab. The kitchen is fully stocked with food, fruit, beverages, snacks, and candy. Jane Street really takes care of its employees.

The hours are also quite reasonable for this kind of job. You'll never have set times that you must come in and leave by. I work about 50 hours per week and am about in the middle. Some people work more, some less. There are also very few to no days where you feel that you ""must"" stay late to finish something. You never work weekends or nights.

The people are awesome. Everyone works hard while they're here, but nobody gets burned out or has unreasonable expectations. There is practically no hierarchy at all, and little to no busy work.

Finally, the firm has very high ethical standards. We will intentionally avoid strategies that, while legal, are ethically in a gray area. I've yet to run into anything truly illegal happen at this place.","The only weird downside is eating lunch at your desk. Traders don't get up from their desk more than a few times a day, and never for longer than to grab food or use the bathroom.","Keep it up, Jane Street is an amazing place to work!",5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,

Former Employee ",full-time, more than a year,30,"* Decision making is extremely academic and meritocratic. It's about what you know, not who you know, though politics did creep up from time to time.
* Extremely small company with heaps of awesome technology. You're guaranteed to learn a lot here.
* Most of the work that I did was extremely unique and very interesting. 
* Jane Street goes to great lengths to ensure that its staff is at least familiar with OCaml and functional programming in general. I think this is a good thing.
* Culture is extremely lax. Office hierarchy exists in name only; everyone, including their ""executive management"" is extremely warm and approachable. Casual clothes policy is great.
* The compensation is fantastic and their benefits/perks package was pretty wild. There is ALWAYS food in the office, and their gym is excellent for most of the popular training programmes out there (sports training, cardio, bodybuilding, basic powerlifting, etc).","* Resourcing problems were pretty evident. 
* Interview process was, in my opinion, too selective for certain roles.
* No true career paths for those looking to get into management, as it doesn't exist there in the same form as it exists in other places. 
* Vacation policy is surprisingly light given the rest of their benefits.
* Leaving for lunch seemed to be universally frowned upon.
* No opportunities to work from home given the nature and structure of the business.
* Lots of unproductive conversations about the smartest/most clever way of doing things, which made many meetings run unnecessarily long and introduced many ""side projects"" that slowed work in other, more key areas down.",Keep putting your people first; everything else will follow.,4.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,2.0,Recommends,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO,,,
